# M05-05 — Compatibility Testing Suite

Create automated compatibility testing: 1) Test matrix: PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 × WooCommerce 8.0, 8.5, 9.0 × WordPress 6.4, 6.5, 6.6. 2) GitHub Actions matrix builds. 3) Test with popular conflicting plugins: Yoast SEO, Elementor, WooCommerce Subscriptions, WPML, WP Rocket. 4) jQuery compatibility (WP admin still uses jQuery). 5) Multisite compatibility testing. 6) REST API compatibility with caching plugins (WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache). 7) Document minimum requirements and known conflicts. 8) Create admin notice for incompatible environments. Acceptance Criteria: Plugin works on all matrix combinations, known conflicts documented with workarounds, admin warnings displayed for unsupported PHP/WC versions.
