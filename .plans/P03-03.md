# P03-03 — Normalize customer service results

Convert `CustomerServiceInterface` and implementation (`src/Services/CustomerService.php`) to return a consistent result type (prefer `ServiceResult`). Update `src/Intent/Handlers/CustomerLookupHandler.php` to consume it. Acceptance: customer lookups have uniform error handling and HTTP mapping.
