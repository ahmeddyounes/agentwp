# P03-07 — Sync OpenAPI and TypeScript types with implementation

Update `docs/openapi.json` to reflect the final request/response formats after Phase 3 changes. Ensure `react/src/types/api.ts` can be regenerated via `npm run generate:types`. Add a CI check to prevent drift. Acceptance: OpenAPI validates and generated types compile.
