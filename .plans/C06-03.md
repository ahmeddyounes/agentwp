# C06-03 — Document and enforce Definition of Done for architecture changes

Add an 'Architecture change DoD' section to `docs/DEVELOPER.md` requiring relevant checks (PHPUnit, PHPCS, PHPStan, React tests where applicable) and documentation updates. Optionally add a convenience script to run the full suite. Acceptance: architecture work has a consistent quality gate.
