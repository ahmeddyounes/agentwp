# C00-02 — Update ARCHITECTURE.md 'Where Things Live' and link hygiene

Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with a short 'Where things live' section listing key folders/files (entrypoint, providers, controllers, intent handlers, services, infrastructure, React UI). Ensure it links to `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` and all other relative links resolve. Acceptance: a new contributor can locate major subsystems in <5 minutes.
