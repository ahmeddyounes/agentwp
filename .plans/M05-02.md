# M05-02 — Integration Test Suite

Create end-to-end integration tests: 1) Use wp-env for WordPress testing environment. 2) REST API integration tests hitting actual endpoints with authenticated requests. 3) OpenAI integration tests using recorded responses (VCR-style recording). 4) WooCommerce integration: test refund processing, order status changes, stock updates against real WC data. 5) Test the complete intent flow: input → API → OpenAI → handler → response. 6) Browser tests using Playwright for Command Deck interactions. 7) Test scenarios: happy path for each feature, error conditions, edge cases (empty store, huge order). Acceptance Criteria: Integration tests cover all major user flows, can run against real OpenAI API (optional flag), browser tests run headlessly in CI, test data reset between runs.
