# C01-02 — Move base REST controller to src/Rest and update namespaces

Move `src/API/RestController.php` to the canonical controller namespace/path (e.g., `src/Rest/RestController.php`) and update all references/imports across controllers, providers, and tests. Keep behavior identical (permissions, nonce, rate limit, response_error, logging). Acceptance: PHPUnit passes and REST endpoints behave unchanged.
