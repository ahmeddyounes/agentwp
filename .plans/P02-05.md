# P02-05 — Add architecture tests for boundaries

Add a PHPUnit test (e.g., `tests/Integration/Architecture/BoundariesTest.php`) that guards key architectural boundaries (no forbidden function calls in service layer, controllers resolve via container, etc.). Acceptance: tests prevent regressions without being flaky.
