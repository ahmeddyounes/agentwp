# C01-01 — Decide canonical REST controller location and naming

Confirm the canonical location/namespace for REST controllers (recommended: all controllers under `src/Rest/` in `AgentWP\\Rest`). Document the decision in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DEVELOPER.md` (how to add a new endpoint). Acceptance: there is exactly one 'blessed' place to add controllers and it is documented.

---

## Implementation Complete

**Decision:** All REST controllers must be placed in `src/Rest/` with namespace `AgentWP\Rest`.

**Documentation added:**

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Updated "Where Things Live" table to mark `src/Rest/` as the canonical location with emphasis.

2. **DEVELOPER.md** - Added new section "Adding a new REST endpoint (core development)" with:
   - Canonical location declaration (`src/Rest/`, `AgentWP\Rest` namespace)
   - Note about legacy `src/API/` controllers
   - Step-by-step guide for adding endpoints
   - Controller conventions

**Legacy note:** `HistoryController` and `ThemeController` remain in `src/API/` for now. The base `RestController` class also lives in `src/API/`. Documentation clarifies that new controllers must go in `src/Rest/`.
