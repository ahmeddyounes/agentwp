# P02-04 — Refactor any boundary violations to use adapters

If static analysis finds violations, refactor the offending code to use existing interfaces (policy, gateways, options/cache). Add new interfaces/adapters only when needed, registered via providers. Acceptance: domain/services code no longer depends on WP/WC globals.
