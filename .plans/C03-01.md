# C03-01 — Make Controllers Container-First (Remove Broken Fallbacks)

Refactor REST controllers to resolve dependencies from the container and remove any fallbacks that lead to incorrect runtime behavior (e.g., `new Engine()` that has no handlers); return a clear 500 error when a required dependency cannot be resolved; Acceptance Criteria: no core controller instantiates domain services directly in normal runtime.
