# P05-02 — Add installed-version tracking and upgrade runner

Add an installed-version option (e.g., `agentwp_installed_version`) and run upgrade steps on version change early in boot (e.g., `plugins_loaded`). Centralize in a small upgrader class (e.g., `src/Plugin/Upgrader.php`). Acceptance: upgrades are idempotent, testable, and documented.
