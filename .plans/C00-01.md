# C00-01 — Reconcile or archive stale architecture inventory doc

Review `docs/architecture-inventory.md` for accuracy vs current runtime wiring (e.g., ScorerRegistry/RateLimiter/RetryExecutor/ServiceResult usage). Either update it to match reality (with concrete file references) or move it to `docs/archive/` and remove/replace any references. Acceptance: docs no longer contradict codebase and all referenced paths exist.
