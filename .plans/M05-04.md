# M05-04 — Performance Optimization

Optimize for speed and efficiency: 1) PHP profiling using Query Monitor to identify slow queries. 2) Optimize WC_Order_Query usage: proper indexing hints, limit fields returned. 3) Implement query result caching: transients for analytics (1hr), object cache for repeated lookups. 4) Frontend bundle optimization: code splitting for chart library (load on demand), tree shaking, minification. 5) Lazy load Command Deck React app (don't load until first Cmd+K). 6) Asset loading: defer non-critical CSS, async JS. 7) Database query limits: cap results to prevent memory issues on large stores. 8) OpenAI request optimization: minimize prompt tokens, cache function schemas. Acceptance Criteria: Initial admin page load adds <100ms, Command Deck opens in <200ms, analytics queries return in <1s for 100k order stores, JS bundle <150KB gzipped.
