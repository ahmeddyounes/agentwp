# M00-03 — CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Create GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows/ for: 1) ci.yml - runs on PR: PHP linting (PHPCS with WordPress standards), PHPUnit tests, Jest tests, ESLint, build verification. 2) release.yml - runs on tag: builds production assets, creates CodeCanyon-ready ZIP, generates changelog from commits. 3) security.yml - runs weekly: dependency vulnerability scanning with Composer audit and npm audit. Include branch protection rules documentation. Acceptance Criteria: CI blocks merges on test failures, release workflow produces valid plugin ZIP under 10MB, security scans report to GitHub Security tab.
