# C03-06 — Remove Service-Level Dependency Fallbacks

Refactor services that currently create their own dependencies (e.g., `new TransientDraftStorage()`) to require injected interfaces, and update providers to always supply them; keep optional integrations (like WooCommerce) behind interface availability checks; Acceptance Criteria: domain/services layer has no hidden instantiation that bypasses providers.
