# P03-05 — Introduce DTOs for complex response payloads

For endpoints/handlers that return large structured payloads (analytics charts, customer profile, search results), introduce DTOs (in `src/DTO/`) and use them internally before final REST serialization. Acceptance: response shapes are explicitly represented and easier to validate/test.
