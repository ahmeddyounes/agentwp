# C04-05 — Convert product/email/analytics/customer functions into executable tools

Implement executable tools for the remaining functions (`search_product`, `prepare_stock_update`, `confirm_stock_update`, `draft_email`, `get_sales_report`, `get_customer_profile`) with DI wiring and stable result shapes. Acceptance: all built-in tool names resolve and execute through the dispatcher.
