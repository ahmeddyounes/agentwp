# C07-01 — Introduce a Capability/Policy Layer

Create a small policy layer (e.g., `src/Security/Policy/*` or `src/Application/Policy/*`) so capability checks live outside domain services; refactor refund/status/stock/email flows accordingly; Acceptance Criteria: domain services no longer call `current_user_can()` directly.
