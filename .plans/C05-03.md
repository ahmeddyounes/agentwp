# C05-03 — Standardize transient prefixes and cache key conventions

Audit uses of `Plugin::TRANSIENT_PREFIX`, `AgentWPConfig::CACHE_PREFIX_*`, and ad-hoc transient keys (REST log, caches). Standardize on one convention and refactor accordingly; ensure uninstall/deactivation cleanup still removes all plugin transients. Acceptance: cache keys are predictable and cleanup remains complete.
