# P01-03 — Configure Vite build for WordPress plugin delivery

Update `react/vite.config.ts` to emit a `manifest.json` and output assets into a plugin-owned directory intended for runtime enqueueing (e.g., `assets/build/`). Ensure `base` is compatible with plugin-relative URLs and chunk loading. Acceptance: `npm run build` produces deterministic output + manifest at the expected path.
