# P03-04 — Normalize order search service results

Convert `OrderSearchServiceInterface` and pipeline implementation (`src/Services/OrderSearch/*`) to return a consistent result type (prefer `ServiceResult`). Update `src/Intent/Handlers/OrderSearchHandler.php` accordingly. Acceptance: order search errors are structured and consistently mapped.
