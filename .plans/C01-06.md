# C01-06 — Strengthen controller boundary tests to cover all controllers

Update `tests/Integration/Architecture/BoundariesTest.php` so REST controller scanning covers the canonical controller directory (and/or both old/new during transition). Ensure tests enforce 'controllers extend the base controller' and 'controllers do not instantiate services directly'. Acceptance: adding a new controller outside the canonical location fails tests.
