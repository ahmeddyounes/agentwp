# M07-02 — Voice Mode Research

Research and prototype voice interface for V1.2: 1) Evaluate Web Speech API browser support and accuracy. 2) Create proof-of-concept: AgentWP\Voice\SpeechRecognition JS class wrapping Web Speech API. 3) Voice command mapping: activate on 'Hey Agent' wake word (if feasible) or button press. 4) Handle interim vs final transcription results. 5) Voice feedback: text-to-speech for responses using SpeechSynthesis API. 6) Accessibility considerations: visual transcript, don't rely on voice only. 7) Privacy documentation: explain voice data processing (browser-only, not sent to server). 8) Create technical feasibility report with browser compatibility matrix, accuracy benchmarks, and recommended implementation approach. Acceptance Criteria: POC transcribes commands with >90% accuracy in quiet environment, works in Chrome/Edge/Safari, technical report recommends go/no-go with justification.
