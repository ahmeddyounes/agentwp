# P04-03 — Add SearchIndexInterface adapter for static subsystem

Add a small interface + adapter layer for search index access (wrapping `src/Search/Index.php`) so consumers can depend on an interface. Update `src/Rest/SearchController.php` (and any other callers) to use it. Acceptance: search can be mocked and swapped without touching controllers.
