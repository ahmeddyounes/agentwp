# C02-07 — Order Search Consolidation (Choose + Wire)

Based on the decision inventory/ADR, consolidate order search into one implementation: either wire `src/Services/OrderSearch/*` via container and retire `src/Services/OrderSearchService.php`, or delete the unused pipeline and keep the existing service; update providers and handlers accordingly; Acceptance Criteria: only one order-search implementation remains and is used by handlers/controllers.
