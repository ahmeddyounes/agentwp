# C03-02 — Resolve FunctionRegistry vs ToolRegistry strategy

Choose and implement a strategy: Option A keep `src/Intent/FunctionRegistry.php` as legacy suggestions; Option B replace it with a tool-driven suggestion system (e.g., `ToolSuggestionRegistry` or derive suggestions from `ToolRegistry` + handler tool lists). Update docs and tests; keep backward compatibility for extension hooks where possible.
