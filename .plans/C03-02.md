# C03-02 — Refactor SettingsController to Use Services

Update `src/Rest/SettingsController.php` to use container-resolved services for settings, API key storage, and OpenAI key validation (via an injected HTTP client/validator); remove direct `wp_remote_get` calls and direct `new Encryption()` usage; Acceptance Criteria: settings and key operations are testable without WordPress HTTP globals.
