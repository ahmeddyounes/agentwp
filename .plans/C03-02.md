# C03-02 — Add current-user context abstraction for services (optional but recommended)

Introduce a small abstraction for runtime user context (e.g., `CurrentUserInterface` or a `WPFunctions::getCurrentUserId()` helper) and update services that call `get_current_user_id()` directly (audit logging/draft confirmation) to use injected context or explicit parameters. Acceptance: services no longer depend on WP globals for user identity and tests cover both paths.
