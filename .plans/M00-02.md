# M00-02 — Docker Development Environment

Create Docker-based development environment with docker-compose.yml including: 1) WordPress container with PHP 8.1+ and WooCommerce 8.x pre-installed. 2) MySQL 8.0 container with persistent volume. 3) Node.js container for React build tooling. 4) Mailhog for email testing. 5) Volume mounts for live code reloading. Include .env.example with all configuration variables. Create setup script (setup.sh) that initializes WooCommerce with sample data. Acceptance Criteria: Running 'docker-compose up' creates fully functional dev environment within 5 minutes, hot reloading works for both PHP and React, sample store has 50+ products and 100+ orders.
