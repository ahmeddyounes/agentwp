# C02-01 — Consolidate Plugin Bootstrap Responsibilities

Audit `src/Plugin.php` for legacy/duplicate responsibilities vs `src/Plugin/*` managers and provider wiring; remove or deprecate unused methods (menu/assets/rest formatting) while keeping activation/deactivation behavior intact; Acceptance Criteria: only one active code path exists for menu/assets/rest wiring and dead/unused code is removed or explicitly deprecated.
