# C07-02 — Standardize Service Results

Adopt `src/DTO/ServiceResult.php` (or a replacement decided earlier) as the standard return type for application/domain services and migrate core services incrementally (start with refund/status/stock); update handlers/controllers to map to API envelopes; Acceptance Criteria: service outcomes are uniform and include codes/messages consistently.
