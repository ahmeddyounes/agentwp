# P01-08 — Update release workflow to package the real UI artifacts

Update `.github/workflows/release.yml` so the packaged zip includes the React build artifacts actually used by `AssetManager` (e.g., `assets/build/*` and manifest) and excludes unused build outputs. Remove/adjust the existing `rsync -a react/dist/ assets/` step if it is no longer correct. Acceptance: release zip contains the required UI assets and the plugin works when installed from the zip.
