# P01-02 — Align WordPress mount node with React app

Make the WordPress-rendered admin page and the React app agree on a single mount element ID. Update either `src/Plugin/AdminMenuManager.php` to render `#agentwp-root` (or `#agentwp-admin-root`) and/or `react/src/main.tsx` to mount to the chosen node. Keep compatibility during migration if both IDs are temporarily present. Acceptance: the chosen mount node exists on the AgentWP admin page and React mounts reliably.
