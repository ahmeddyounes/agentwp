# C03-03 — Deprecate legacy IntentClassifier and document migration

Add explicit deprecation markers for `src/Intent/IntentClassifier.php` (DocBlock `@deprecated` and/or `_doing_it_wrong` on construction) and ensure production code does not use it. Update ADR 0003 and `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` notes to reflect deprecation/removal timing. Acceptance: no runtime behavior change and deprecation is clearly communicated.
