# C03-03 — Fix Engine default mapping drift

Audit `src/Intent/Engine.php::register_default_functions()` (e.g., `select_orders`, `bulk_update`) against the actually registered schemas/executors and handler tool lists. Remove or fully implement missing mappings so `function_suggestions` is accurate. Add/adjust tests to prevent regression.
