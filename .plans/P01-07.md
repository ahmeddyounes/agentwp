# P01-07 — Decide Command Deck surfaces and implement hooks

Decide whether the UI should load only on the AgentWP page or also on WooCommerce screens. Implement the chosen behavior in `src/Plugin/AssetManager.php` (enqueue rules) and `src/Plugin/AdminMenuManager.php` (mount node placement). Acceptance: assets load only where intended, and UI is accessible from the intended screens.
