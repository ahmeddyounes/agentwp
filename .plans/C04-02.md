# C04-02 — Deprecate Legacy Handler Discovery Methods

Implement a formal deprecation strategy for handler discovery methods (`getIntent()`/`getSupportedIntents()`), including documentation and (optional) runtime warnings/logging in dev; Acceptance Criteria: deprecation is documented and there is a clear removal date/condition.
