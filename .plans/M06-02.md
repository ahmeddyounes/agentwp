# M06-02 — Demo Site Automation

Create automated demo site infrastructure: 1) WP-CLI script to install WordPress + WooCommerce + AgentWP with configuration. 2) Sample data generator: 100 products across 10 categories, 500 orders with varied statuses, 200 customers, realistic order dates spanning 6 months. 3) Demo API key (rate-limited OpenAI key for demos only). 4) Daily reset cron: restore sample data, clear user-generated content, reset settings. 5) Docker Compose for self-hosted demo or deploy script for Cloudways/GridPane. 6) Demo mode flag: enable watermark, disable actual payment processing, show 'Demo' badge. 7) Guided tour using Shepherd.js or similar. Acceptance Criteria: Demo site deployable in <15 minutes, daily reset runs without errors, sample data realistic enough for meaningful demos, guided tour covers 5 key features.
