# C01-03 — ADR 0004: OpenAI Client Architecture

Create `docs/adr/0004-openai-client-architecture.md` deciding whether to integrate the modular components in `src/AI/Client/*` into `OpenAIClient` or delete them, and whether HTTP + retries must go through `HttpClientInterface` + `RetryExecutor`; include migration steps and how streaming is handled; Acceptance Criteria: ADR makes an explicit choice and lists the concrete refactor steps.
