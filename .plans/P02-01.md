# P02-01 — Inventory and document supported extension points

Create a single source of truth doc (e.g., `docs/EXTENSIONS.md`) listing supported actions/filters and their signatures (intent handlers, scorers, providers, REST controllers). Link it from `docs/DEVELOPER.md`. Acceptance: extension developers have an explicit, maintained list of supported hooks.
