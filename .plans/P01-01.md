# P01-01 — Confirm single supported frontend

Decide whether the shipped admin UI is (A) legacy wp-element bundle in `assets/agentwp-admin.*` or (B) the Vite React app in `react/` (preferred). Record the decision in `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` under Phase 1, including migration strategy, fallback behavior (if any), and the date/version the old path will be removed. Acceptance: the repo has one clearly documented UI source of truth.
