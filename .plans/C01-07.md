# C01-07 — Update container wiring and registrar tests after REST refactor

Update `tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php` (and any other tests) for new namespaces/paths. Verify `RestRouteRegistrar` still registers tagged controllers first and falls back to defaults. Acceptance: container wiring tests pass and default controller list is correct.
