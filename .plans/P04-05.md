# P04-05 — Expand container wiring tests for new adapters

Update/add integration tests (e.g., `tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php`) to ensure new adapters (usage tracker, search index) resolve correctly and controllers can `resolveRequired()` them. Acceptance: wiring failures are caught by tests.
