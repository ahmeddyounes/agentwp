# P03-02 — Normalize analytics service results

Convert analytics to a consistent result type (prefer `ServiceResult` or a typed DTO) and update `src/Rest/AnalyticsController.php` to map it to responses consistently. Update `src/Contracts/AnalyticsServiceInterface.php` accordingly. Acceptance: analytics endpoints have uniform success/failure handling and clear types.
