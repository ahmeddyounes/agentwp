# C05-01 — Unify OpenAI Client Implementation (Per ADR)

Per ADR 0004, either integrate `src/AI/Client/*` into `src/AI/OpenAIClient.php` (preferred) or delete the unused path; ensure there is only one implementation for request building, tool normalization, response parsing, and streaming; Acceptance Criteria: no duplicated OpenAI logic remains in parallel modules.
