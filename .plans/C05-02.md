# C05-02 — Move OpenAI HTTP to HttpClientInterface

Refactor `OpenAIClient` to use injected `HttpClientInterface` (and any WordPress/VIP safe wrappers in `WordPressHttpClient`) rather than direct `wp_remote_*` calls; update factory/provider wiring accordingly; Acceptance Criteria: OpenAI client can be tested with fake HTTP without WordPress globals.
