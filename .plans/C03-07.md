# C03-07 — Add Tests for Container Wiring + Resolution

Add PHPUnit tests to verify: container registers the expected bindings, `Engine` resolves with registered handlers/registries, and REST controllers resolve dependencies via `RestController::resolve()`; Acceptance Criteria: tests fail if a controller/service reintroduces DI bypass.
