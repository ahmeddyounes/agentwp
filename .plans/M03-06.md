# M03-06 — Chart.js Integration

Integrate Chart.js for visual analytics: 1) Install chart.js and react-chartjs-2. 2) Create ChartCard component supporting: line (trends), bar (comparisons), doughnut (breakdowns). 3) Sales trend chart: daily revenue for selected period with previous period overlay. 4) Comparison bar chart: this period vs last period metrics. 5) Category breakdown doughnut: revenue by product category. 6) Responsive sizing within Command Deck modal. 7) Dark/light mode color schemes (automatic switching). 8) Interactive tooltips with formatted currency values. 9) Chart export button (PNG download). 10) Accessibility: include data table alternative for screen readers. Acceptance Criteria: Charts render within 200ms, update smoothly on period change, colors pass WCAG contrast requirements in both themes, exported images are high quality (2x resolution).
