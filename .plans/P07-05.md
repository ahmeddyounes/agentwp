# P07-05 — Add a single-command local validation script

Add a repo-root script (e.g., `scripts/validate.sh`) that runs PHP unit/static checks and React lint/test/build (and OpenAPI validation) in the same way CI does. Document in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`. Acceptance: contributors can reproduce CI locally with one command.
