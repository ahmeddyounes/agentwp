# C04-01 — Add HandlesIntent Attributes to Built-in Handlers

Add `#[HandlesIntent(...)]` attributes to all built-in intent handlers in `src/Intent/Handlers/*` so each handler has explicit intent registration; Acceptance Criteria: `Engine` can register all built-in handlers without relying on legacy detection methods.
