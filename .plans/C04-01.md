# C04-01 — Decide tool execution architecture and document it

Pick a single approach for tools: (A) executable tool classes (schema + execute) with a dispatcher, or (B) central argument normalizers/executors. Document the chosen approach (short ADR in `docs/adr/` + update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). Acceptance: contributors have one clear recipe for adding a tool.
