# C01-05 — Update Boot/Composition Docs

Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to include an explicit boot/composition diagram (bootstrap → Plugin → providers → route registrar/formatter → controllers → services/handlers) and link to ADRs 0001–0005 and `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`; Acceptance Criteria: A new contributor can trace runtime wiring end-to-end from docs without reading code.
