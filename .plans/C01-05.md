# C01-05 — Clarify API vs infrastructure for RateLimiter implementation

Decide where the rate limiter implementation should live (keep in `src/API/` with clear naming or move to an infrastructure-focused namespace like `src/Infrastructure/RateLimiting/`). Apply the move/rename (including namespaces) and update `src/Providers/RestServiceProvider.php` bindings and any imports. Acceptance: no functional changes; all tests pass.
