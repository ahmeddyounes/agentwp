# C06-01 — Automate OpenAPI → TypeScript generation verification

Ensure `react/src/types/api.ts` is generated from `docs/openapi.json` deterministically; add/verify a `react` script (e.g., `npm run generate:types`) and add a verification step (CI or local script) that fails when generated types are stale. Document in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`. Acceptance: type generation drift is caught automatically.
