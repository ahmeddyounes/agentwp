# C06-01 — Single Rate Limiting Implementation in REST Layer

Implement the single rate limiting approach chosen in ADR 0005: either inject `RateLimiterInterface` into `RestController` (and remove static limiting) or remove the DI rate limiter and keep static; ensure Retry-After is surfaced in responses; Acceptance Criteria: only one rate limiting mechanism exists and is covered by tests.
