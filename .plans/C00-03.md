# C00-03 — Add lightweight docs path/link check script

Add a simple script (e.g., `scripts/check-doc-links.php`) that scans `docs/**/*.md` for relative markdown links and fails if targets are missing/renamed; document usage in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` and optionally add a Composer script entry. Acceptance: running the script locally catches broken doc links deterministically.
