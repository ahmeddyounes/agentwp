# M01-06 — Command Deck Modal - Basic

Build the React modal interface (Command Deck) using React 18 and TailwindCSS: 1) Floating modal overlay with semi-transparent backdrop. 2) Trigger: global hotkey listener (Cmd+K Mac, Ctrl+K Windows), admin bar button click. 3) Visual style: Linear.app aesthetic, dark mode default, 600px max width, centered vertically. 4) Components: Omnibox (text input with placeholder 'Ask AgentWP anything...'), Stage (results area), Status Bar (latency + token cost). 5) Input handling: submit on Enter, close on Escape, focus trap within modal. 6) Loading state with skeleton animation. 7) Basic request/response flow to /agentwp/v1/intent endpoint. 8) Render markdown in responses using react-markdown. 9) Persist modal open state in session. Acceptance Criteria: Modal opens within 100ms of hotkey press, doesn't conflict with browser/OS shortcuts, closes cleanly without memory leaks, works across Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge, meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility.
