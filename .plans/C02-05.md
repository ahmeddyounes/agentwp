# C02-05 — Define and Implement Demo Credential Rules

Make demo-mode credential behavior explicit (demo key vs stubbed responses) and implement it consistently in `src/AI/AIClientFactory.php` and any API key validation logic; update docs as needed; Acceptance Criteria: demo mode produces deterministic behavior and never accidentally uses a real key when demo mode is enabled.
