# P01-05 — Plumb runtime config into the React app

Ensure the React app consumes `window.agentwpSettings` (nonce, REST root, version, demoMode, theme). If needed, expand `AssetManager::getScriptLocalization()` and update React API client/config initialization so it uses the localized REST root + nonce consistently. Acceptance: API calls succeed via WP nonce middleware, and demo/theme flags reflect server settings.
