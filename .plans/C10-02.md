# C10-02 — Final Documentation and Migration Notes

Do a final documentation pass to ensure `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`, ADRs, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPER.md` are consistent; add migration notes for extension developers and summarize changes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; Acceptance Criteria: documentation is coherent and reflects the final architecture.
