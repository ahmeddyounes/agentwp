- The section includes a table listing 15 key locations in the codebase with their purpose:
  - Entrypoint (`agentwp.php`)
  - Plugin bootstrap (`src/Plugin.php`)
  - Service providers (`src/Providers/`)
  - REST controllers (`src/Rest/`)
  - Intent handlers (`src/Intent/`)
  - Domain services (`src/Services/`)
  - Infrastructure/gateways (`src/Infrastructure/`)
  - Contracts/interfaces (`src/Contracts/`)
  - DTOs (`src/DTO/`)
  - Container (`src/Container/`)
  - Security/policy layer (`src/Security/`)
  - React UI (`react/src/`)
  - Built assets (`assets/`)
  - Documentation (`docs/`)
  - Tests (`tests/`)
- Added a link to `ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` directly in this section for easy discovery

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Review the changes
git diff docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

# Verify all relative links resolve
cd docs && for f in ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md search-index.md DEVELOPER.md CHANGELOG.md openapi.json adr/0001-rest-controller-dependency-resolution.md; do [ -f "$f" ] && echo "✓ $f" || echo "✗ $f"; done
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None identified. The change is additive documentation only and does not affect runtime behavior.
