Agent final message (file: C01-03.claude.impl.last.md):

The ADR has been created. Let me verify it meets all the acceptance criteria from the spec:

1. **ADR makes an explicit choice** - Yes, the decision is clear:
   - Delete the modular components in `src/AI/Client/*`
   - Refactor `OpenAIClient` to use `HttpClientInterface` + `RetryExecutor`
   - HTTP + retries must go through these infrastructure abstractions

2. **Lists the concrete refactor steps** - Yes, 6 phases with specific steps

3. **Migration steps** - Yes, covered in the Refactoring Steps section

4. **How streaming is handled** - Yes, covered in the "Streaming Behavior" section

---

**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**
- Created `docs/adr/0004-openai-client-architecture.md` with a comprehensive decision record
- Decision: Delete unused modular components (`src/AI/Client/*`) and refactor `OpenAIClient` to use existing infrastructure abstractions (`HttpClientInterface` + `RetryExecutor`)
- Includes 6-phase migration plan with concrete steps
- Documents streaming behavior and explains why it remains internal
- Addresses backward compatibility via optional constructor injection

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check the ADR was created
cat docs/adr/0004-openai-client-architecture.md

# Verify it follows project ADR conventions
ls -la docs/adr/
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
1. **Implementation risk**: The actual refactoring of `OpenAIClient` (Phase 2-4) needs careful testing to ensure streaming and retry behavior is preserved
2. **Follow-up task needed**: Execute Phase 1 (delete unused components) as an immediate cleanup
3. **Follow-up task needed**: Execute Phases 2-6 to complete the refactoring per this ADR
4. **Test coverage**: Unit tests for `OpenAIClient` should be added before the refactoring to establish baseline behavior

Agent final message (file: C01-03.claude.after1.last.md):

**Self-review complete.** The ADR looks good and meets all acceptance criteria from the spec.

**Summary of what I did:**

Created `docs/adr/0004-openai-client-architecture.md` - a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record that:

1. **Makes explicit choices:**
   - Delete unused modular components (`src/AI/Client/*`)
   - Refactor `OpenAIClient` to use `HttpClientInterface` + `RetryExecutor`
   - Keep streaming internal to `OpenAIClient`

2. **Lists concrete refactor steps:** 6 phases with specific actionable items

3. **Addresses migration:** Backward-compatible constructor injection pattern

4. **Documents streaming handling:** Explains why it remains internal with DoS protections

The ADR follows the same format as existing ADRs (0003-intent-classification-strategy.md) with Context, Decision, Consequences, and References sections.
