Agent final message (file: P01-09.claude.impl.last.md):

The implementation is complete. Let me provide the final summary.

---

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Created `scripts/build-assets.sh`** - A single documented command that:
   - Installs npm dependencies if needed (detects when package.json changes)
   - Runs the Vite production build with TypeScript checking
   - Outputs assets to `assets/build/` (the location WordPress enqueues from)
   - Generates the manifest at `assets/build/.vite/manifest.json`

2. **Updated `docs/DEVELOPER.md`** - Added a new "Building UI assets" section that:
   - Documents the `./scripts/build-assets.sh` command as the primary way to build UI assets
   - Explains what the script does (4-step process)
   - Clarifies where assets go and how WordPress uses the manifest
   - Reorganized the existing commands into a "Development workflow" subsection for clarity

**How to verify:**

```bash
# Run the build script
./scripts/build-assets.sh

# Verify assets exist
ls assets/build/assets/
ls assets/build/.vite/manifest.json
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None identified. The script is idempotent and can be run safely at any time.
