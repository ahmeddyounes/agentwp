Agent final message (file: C00-03.claude.impl.last.md):

---

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

1. **Created `scripts/check-doc-links.php`** - A lightweight PHP script that:
   - Scans all `docs/**/*.md` files recursively
   - Extracts relative markdown links (excludes absolute URLs and anchor-only links)
   - Resolves relative paths (handles `./`, `../`, etc.)
   - Reports broken links with file:line references
   - Exits with code 1 if broken links are found, 0 if all links are valid

2. **Updated `docs/DEVELOPER.md`** - Added documentation section "Documentation link checking" explaining usage

3. **Updated `composer.json`** - Added `docs:check-links` script entry

## How to verify

```bash
# Run the script directly
php scripts/check-doc-links.php

# Or via Composer
composer run docs:check-links
```

Expected output when all links are valid:
```
Documentation Link Checker
==================================================

Scanning docs/ for markdown files...
Found 24 markdown files

Checked 53 links in 7 files

--------------------------------------------------

All links are valid.
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Low risk**: Script only checks relative markdown links within `docs/`. External URLs are intentionally excluded to avoid network dependencies.
- **Potential follow-up**: Could be added to CI pipeline for automated checking on PRs
- **Limitation**: Does not validate anchor targets within files (e.g., `file.md#section` only checks that `file.md` exists, not that `#section` is a valid heading)
