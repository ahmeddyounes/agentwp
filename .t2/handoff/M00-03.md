## 2026-01-06T18:16:48.972840Z — codex — impl

Command:

codex exec --color never --full-auto --output-last-message /Users/ahmedyounis/Documents/Projects/agentwp/.logs/M00-03.codex.impl.last.md -
```

Return code: 0

Agent final message (file: M00-03.codex.impl.last.md):

Implemented CI/CD workflows for PR checks, tagged releases, and weekly security audits, plus SARIF conversion and branch protection guidance to satisfy M00-03.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added CI workflow for PHP/Node linting, tests, and build verification in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Added tag-based release workflow that builds assets, packages a CodeCanyon-ready zip, enforces size, and publishes release notes in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- Added weekly security audit workflow with Composer/npm scans uploaded to the Security tab in `.github/workflows/security.yml`.
- Added SARIF conversion helper in `scripts/audit_to_sarif.py` and branch protection guidance in `docs/branch-protection.md`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- N/A (no local verification commands specified)

Risks / follow-ups:
- CI steps skip PHPCS/PHPUnit/Jest/ESLint when configs or scripts are missing; ensure those tools/configs are added as the codebase grows.
- Release packaging currently excludes `react/` and `scripts/`; confirm the final plugin layout and adjust exclusions as needed.
- Composer audit requires `composer.lock`; add it once PHP dependencies are introduced.
