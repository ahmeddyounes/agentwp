Status: NEEDS-REVIEW

Summary of changes
- Updated `tests/Fakes/FakeWPFunctions.php` so `applyFilters` is variadic and captures arguments consistently with the interface.

How to verify
- `composer run phpstan`

Risks / follow-ups
- `composer run phpstan` currently fails with “If condition is always true” in `src/Infrastructure/RateLimiting/RateLimiter.php:227`. This appears unrelated to this change and needs separate attention.
