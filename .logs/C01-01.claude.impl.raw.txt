{"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"duration_ms":161698,"duration_api_ms":159249,"num_turns":19,"result":"All documentation links are valid. Let me provide the final summary.\n\n---\n\n**Status:** DONE\n\n**Summary of changes:**\n\n1. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Updated the \"Where Things Live\" table to emphasize `src/Rest/` as the **canonical location** for REST controllers with namespace `AgentWP\\Rest`. Added explicit statement that all new controllers must be added here.\n\n2. **docs/DEVELOPER.md** - Made two updates:\n   - Changed overview to remove ambiguity about `src/API/` and clearly state `src/Rest/` as the canonical location\n   - Added new section \"Adding a new REST endpoint (core development)\" with:\n     - Clear canonical location specification (`src/Rest/`, `AgentWP\\Rest` namespace)\n     - Note about legacy controllers in `src/API/`\n     - Step-by-step guide for adding new endpoints\n     - Controller conventions\n\n3. **.plans/C01-01.md** - Updated spec file with implementation summary\n\n**How to verify:**\n\n```bash\n# Check the changes\ngrep -n \"Canonical\" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md docs/DEVELOPER.md\n\n# Verify documentation links are valid\ncomposer run docs:check-links\n\n# View the new section in DEVELOPER.md\ngrep -A 10 \"Adding a new REST endpoint\" docs/DEVELOPER.md\n```\n\n**Risks / follow-ups:**\n\n- **Legacy migration:** `HistoryController` and `ThemeController` still exist in `src/API/`. A future task should migrate these to `src/Rest/` to fully consolidate the codebase.\n- **Base class location:** The `RestController` base class remains in `src/API/`. This is acceptable since it's shared infrastructure, but could be moved to a more neutral location like `src/Rest/Base/` or kept where it is.\n- **No code changes:** This task only documents the decision. No actual controller migration was performed, which is consistent with the spec's scope.","session_id":"289ff6ee-1199-42e8-8588-1819153b49aa","total_cost_usd":1.0529366500000004,"usage":{"input_tokens":16668,"cache_creation_input_tokens":44039,"cache_read_input_tokens":927679,"output_tokens":4986,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":44039}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":16668,"outputTokens":4986,"cacheReadInputTokens":927679,"cacheCreationInputTokens":44039,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.94707325,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":9611,"outputTokens":2868,"cacheReadInputTokens":136474,"cacheCreationInputTokens":54612,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.10586340000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"8e770229-b5d2-437c-94f1-d48d9593a073"}
