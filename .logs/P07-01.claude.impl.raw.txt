The step:\n- Runs after PHPUnit and before OpenAPI validation\n- Checks if PHPStan is installed (`vendor/bin/phpstan` exists)\n- Checks if a PHPStan config file exists (`phpstan.neon` or `phpstan.neon.dist`)\n- Executes `composer run phpstan` which includes the memory limit (`-d memory_limit=1G`) already defined in composer.json\n\n## How to Verify\n\n1. Create a PR and observe the CI workflow - PHPStan should run as part of the `php` job\n2. Locally verify the script will run:\n   ```bash\n   composer run phpstan\n   ```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n- **Low risk**: The step follows the same defensive pattern as other CI steps (skips gracefully if tools/config missing)\n- **Potential follow-up**: If PHPStan finds existing errors in the codebase, they will block PRs until fixed. Run `composer run phpstan` locally first to ensure the codebase is clean before merging this change.","session_id":"061371fb-1fc0-4795-80d0-3e5e7cab6ced","total_cost_usd":0.31016000000000005,"usage":{"input_tokens":876,"cache_creation_input_tokens":25916,"cache_read_input_tokens":195810,"output_tokens":1836,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":25916}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":876,"outputTokens":1836,"cacheReadInputTokens":195810,"cacheCreationInputTokens":25916,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.31016000000000005,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"9ca8f71e-157d-4a2f-b035-069b25ca1857"}
