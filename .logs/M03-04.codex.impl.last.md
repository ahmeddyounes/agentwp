Status: DONE
Summary of changes:
- Implemented sales analytics reporting with WooCommerce analytics table queries, period handling, comparison mode, caching, and currency formatting in `src/Handlers/AnalyticsHandler.php`.
- Added top products/categories aggregation and percentage-change calculations, with formatted currency companion fields in `src/Handlers/AnalyticsHandler.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- WooCommerce analytics table schemas can vary; if `total_sales`/`product_net_revenue` columns are unavailable, totals fall back to `net_total` and top lists default to revenue=0.
- If you want percentage change to always show two decimals (independent of currency precision), adjust `calculate_percentage_change` in `src/Handlers/AnalyticsHandler.php`.
