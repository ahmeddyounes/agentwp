Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Made `HooksInterface::applyFilters()` variadic to match real usage and PHPDoc.
- Updated `WPFunctions::applyFilters()` signature and implementation to forward variadic args directly to `apply_filters`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- Not provided (no format/lint/test commands in task spec).

Risks / follow-ups
- Low risk; behavior unchanged aside from signature alignment. If other implementations of `HooksInterface` exist outside this repo, they must be updated to the new variadic signature.
