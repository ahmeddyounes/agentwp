## Status: DONE

### Summary of Changes

Deleted the unused `src/AI/Client/*` directory containing 6 files:
- `ParsedResponse.php` - DTO for parsed responses
- `RequestBuilder.php` - Request payload builder
- `ResponseParser.php` - Non-streaming response parser
- `StreamParser.php` - SSE streaming response parser
- `ToolNormalizer.php` - Function/tool definition normalizer
- `UsageEstimator.php` - Token usage estimator

**Rationale:** Per ADR 0004, these classes duplicated logic already present in `src/AI/OpenAIClient.php`. They were completely unused—no imports existed anywhere in the codebase, and `OpenAIClient.php` contains its own inline implementations of the same functionality. Deleting them ensures there is now only one implementation for:
- Request building (`chat()` method, lines 82-175)
- Tool normalization (`normalize_tools()` method, lines 364-402)
- Response parsing (`parse_response_body()`, lines 515-557)
- Stream parsing (`parse_stream_response()`, lines 563-672)
- Usage estimation (`estimate_usage()`, lines 730-748)

### How to Verify

```bash
# Verify Client directory is gone
ls src/AI/Client 2>&1  # Should show "No such file or directory"

# Run the OpenAIClient tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/AI/OpenAIClientTest.php

# Regenerate autoload to confirm no broken references
composer dump-autoload
```

### Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk:** The deleted classes had zero usage across the codebase
- **No follow-ups needed:** The acceptance criteria is met—no duplicated OpenAI logic remains in parallel modules
