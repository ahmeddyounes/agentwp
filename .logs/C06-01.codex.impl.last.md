Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added `check:types` and a dedicated checker script to centralize OpenAPI type drift detection (`react/package.json`, `react/scripts/check-openapi-types.cjs`).
- Updated local validation and CI to use the shared check (`scripts/validate.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- Documented the verification workflow in `docs/DEVELOPER.md`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- `cd react && npm run check:types`
- `./scripts/validate.sh --node`

Risks / follow-ups
- `npm run check:types` regenerates `react/src/types/api.ts`; commit the file if it changes.
- The check relies on `git diff`; ensure git is available in the environment.
