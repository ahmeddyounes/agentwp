Status: DONE

Added ADR 0009 documenting the decision to keep WP‑Cron for background jobs, with the rationale, mitigations, and a compatibility plan for environments that disable WP‑Cron.  
Details captured in `docs/adr/0009-background-job-scheduling.md`.

Summary of changes
- Added `docs/adr/0009-background-job-scheduling.md` with the cron vs Action Scheduler decision and follow-up plan.

How to verify (exact commands)
- Not run (no verification commands provided)

Risks / follow-ups
- Revisit Action Scheduler integration if AgentWP later requires WooCommerce or background workloads increase.
- Ensure deployment docs mention configuring a real system cron when `DISABLE_WP_CRON` is set.
