Implemented a unit smoke test to enforce nonce checks on all state-changing REST routes registered by controllers.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added `tests/Unit/Rest/RestRouteNonceSmokeTest.php` to scan all `src/Rest/*Controller.php` registrations and assert `permission_callback` uses `permissions_check` for non-GET methods.
- Included a minimal `WP_REST_Server` stub for unit tests to keep route registration constants available.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite unit --filter RestRouteNonceSmokeTest`

Risks / follow-ups:
- None noted; test assumes routes are registered directly in each controller’s `register_routes()` method.
