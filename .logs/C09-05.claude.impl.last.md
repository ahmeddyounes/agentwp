**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created 4 new Playwright E2E test files (547 lines total) to expand test coverage for core admin workflows:

1. **`tests/e2e/settings-flow.spec.js`** (118 lines, 9 tests)
   - Settings retrieval and defaults
   - Settings update and persistence
   - API key storage, retrieval, and deletion
   - Invalid API key format rejection
   - Usage statistics with different periods

2. **`tests/e2e/intent-prompt.spec.js`** (158 lines, 12 tests)
   - Empty/missing prompt validation
   - Prompts with context and metadata
   - Intent classification for order status, refund, stock update, email draft, and analytics queries
   - Full intent flow integration tests

3. **`tests/e2e/analytics.spec.js`** (83 lines, 9 tests)
   - Analytics endpoint for 7d, 30d, 90d periods
   - Invalid period rejection
   - Authentication requirement
   - Data structure validation

4. **`tests/e2e/error-handling.spec.js`** (188 lines, 17 tests)
   - REST API error responses (intent, settings, search, usage)
   - WooCommerce operation errors (refund, status, stock with invalid IDs)
   - Authentication and authorization checks
   - Consistent error/success response format validation
   - Health endpoint public access and caching headers

**Total new tests: 47 tests** (increased from 13 existing tests to 60 total)

## How to Verify

```bash
# List all tests to confirm discovery
./node_modules/.bin/playwright test --list

# Run tests (requires wp-env running with test data)
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test files
./node_modules/.bin/playwright test settings-flow
./node_modules/.bin/playwright test intent-prompt
./node_modules/.bin/playwright test analytics
./node_modules/.bin/playwright test error-handling
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **E2E tests require running WordPress environment** - Tests require `wp-env` with WooCommerce and the test tools mu-plugin active. Set `AGENTWP_E2E=true` in the environment.

2. **API key tests may fail with real validation** - Some tests use dummy API keys (`sk-test-*`). If OpenAI validation is enabled in production, tests requiring valid API responses may need adjustment or mocking.

3. **Analytics service implementation dependency** - Analytics tests depend on `AnalyticsServiceInterface` being properly wired in the container.
