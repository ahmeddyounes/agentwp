Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added AES-256-CTR encryption/decryption with legacy AES-256-GCM support and rotation logic in `src/Security/Encryption.php`.
- Switched API key storage to the new encryption class and added automatic rotation on settings fetch in `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`.
- Updated encryption details in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to match AES-256-CTR behavior.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- If WordPress salts rotate, re-encryption only works when prior materials are supplied via the `agentwp_encryption_rotation_materials` filter; otherwise the key must be re-entered.
- Saving keys depends on OpenSSL being available; failures return a generic encryption error.
