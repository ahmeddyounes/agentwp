The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary.

---

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **Created `scripts/validate.sh`** - A single-command local validation script that runs all CI checks locally, allowing contributors to reproduce CI before pushing. The script:
   - Runs PHP checks: PHPCS, PHPUnit, PHPStan, and OpenAPI validation
   - Runs Node/React checks: OpenAPI types generation check, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest tests, and production build
   - Provides `--php` and `--node` flags for selective execution
   - Outputs colored status messages and a summary of passed/failed checks
   - Installs dependencies automatically if needed

2. **Updated `docs/DEVELOPER.md`** - Added documentation for the validation script in the "Local development" section, explaining:
   - How to run the script
   - What checks it runs
   - Available command-line options

## How to verify

```bash
# View help
./scripts/validate.sh --help

# Run PHP checks only
./scripts/validate.sh --php

# Run Node/React checks only
./scripts/validate.sh --node

# Run all checks (same as CI)
./scripts/validate.sh
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **Existing CI issues**: The script correctly identifies existing issues in the codebase (PHPCS warnings, PHPUnit errors, Prettier formatting issues). These are pre-existing problems, not issues with the validation script.

2. **Dependency installation**: The script runs `npm ci` or `npm install` and `composer install` which can take time on first run. This is expected and matches CI behavior.

3. **OpenAPI types check**: The script checks if generated TypeScript types match the committed version using `git diff`. If there's drift, contributors need to regenerate and commit the types.
