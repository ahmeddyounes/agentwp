**Self-review complete.** The task is fully implemented:

**Summary:**
- Created `docs/architecture-inventory.md` with a comprehensive inventory of all 7 stranded subsystems listed in the spec
- Each subsystem has:
  - Location and file list
  - Current status
  - Analysis of why it's stranded
  - **Explicit decision** (DELETE, INTEGRATE, or DEFER/INTEGRATE LATER)
  - **Owner task/epic reference** linking to Architecture Improvement Plan phases
  - Migration steps where applicable
- Includes a summary table for quick reference
- Cross-references existing ADRs (0003, 0004, 0005) where decisions were already documented

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- AI Client Components → DELETE (Epic D)
- Scorer Registry → INTEGRATE (Epic C)
- Rate Limiter Service → INTEGRATE (Epic E)
- Retry Executor → INTEGRATE (Epic D)
- ServiceResult → DEFER (Epic F)
- EmailContextBuilder → DEFER (Future)
- OrderSearch Pipeline → INTEGRATE (Epic F)

No code changes needed - this was a documentation task. The only uncommitted file relevant to this task is `docs/architecture-inventory.md`.
