Implemented bulk action workflow and background processing with draft/confirm previews, criteria parsing, progress polling, rollback storage, and CSV export in `src/Handlers/BulkHandler.php`, and registered the Action Scheduler hook in `src/Plugin.php` to run queued jobs.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added bulk operations handler with selection, draft/confirm, async processing, polling progress, rollback, and CSV export in `src/Handlers/BulkHandler.php`.
- Registered the bulk job Action Scheduler hook in `src/Plugin.php`.

How to verify
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Async processing depends on Action Scheduler availability; if missing, large batches run synchronously.
- Order tags use `shop_order_tag` when available and fall back to `_agentwp_order_tags` meta; adjust via `agentwp_order_tag_taxonomy` if needed.
- Consider adding a dedicated REST endpoint for progress/rollback polling if clients need a stable API surface.
