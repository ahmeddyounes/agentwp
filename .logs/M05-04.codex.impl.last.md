Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Lazy-loaded the Command Deck app and ChartCard chunk, with Suspense fallbacks and a dedicated chart vendor chunk for on-demand loading (`react/src/main.jsx`, `react/components/cards/index.js`, `react/src/App.jsx`, `react/vite.config.js`).
- Tightened order query usage to return IDs, added result caps with truncation metadata, and introduced object-cache lookups for order summaries and product categories (`src/Handlers/OrderSearchHandler.php`, `src/Handlers/CustomerHandler.php`, `src/Intent/ContextBuilder.php`).
- Reduced OpenAI prompt payload size via pruning and cached tool schemas; analytics cache TTL aligned to 1 hour (`src/Handlers/EmailDraftHandler.php`, `src/AI/Functions/AbstractFunction.php`, `src/Handlers/AnalyticsHandler.php`).

How to verify
- No automated verification commands were provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Customer metrics now sample up to 2000 orders; totals/ltv may be understated for very large customer histories.
- First Command Deck open now waits on async chunk load; confirm the 200ms open target in a production build.
- Analytics responses may be up to 1 hour stale due to the unified cache TTL.
