## Summary

**Status: DONE**

### Summary of Changes

The task was to verify and fix chunk/static asset URL correctness for React chunks loading from the plugin URL. After analysis, the existing implementation was already correct:

1. **Vite Configuration** (`react/vite.config.ts`):
   - Uses `base: './'` for relative asset paths
   - Outputs to `assets/build/` with hashed filenames
   - Generates a manifest for WordPress to read

2. **WordPress Asset Loading** (`src/Plugin/AssetManager.php`):
   - Entry script is enqueued with an absolute URL from `plugin_dir_url()`
   - Uses `type="module"` attribute for ES module support
   - Vite's preload helper resolves relative imports using `import.meta.url`, which correctly resolves to the absolute script URL
   - Static imports (chunks) also resolve correctly since ES modules use the importing script's URL as the base

3. **Change Made**:
   - Added `assetsUrl` to the script localization data for debugging and potential future use

### How to Verify

1. **Build the assets**:
   ```bash
   cd react && npm run build
   ```

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   cd react && npm test
   ```

3. **Manual verification** in a WordPress environment:
   - Install the plugin in WordPress (standard, subdirectory, or multisite)
   - Navigate to an AgentWP admin page
   - Open browser DevTools Network tab
   - Verify no 404 errors for JS/CSS chunks
   - All chunk requests should load from the correct plugin URL

### Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low Risk**: The implementation relies on standard ES module behavior and `import.meta.url`, which is well-supported in modern browsers
- **Potential Follow-up**: If issues arise on specific WordPress configurations, the `assetsUrl` in `window.agentwpSettings` can be used to implement a runtime base URL fallback
- **No breaking changes**: The only code change adds an optional property to the settings object
