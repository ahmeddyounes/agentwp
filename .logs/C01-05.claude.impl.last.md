The implementation is complete. Let me provide the final summary.

---

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to include:

1. **Boot/Composition Diagram** - A comprehensive Mermaid flowchart showing the full bootstrap sequence:
   - Bootstrap phase (`agentwp.php`)
   - Plugin singleton initialization
   - Service provider registration phase (5 providers)
   - Detailed breakdown of what each key provider registers
   - Service provider boot phase (hooks registered)
   - Runtime request flow

2. **Step-by-Step Bootstrap Sequence** - Prose explanation of the 5-phase boot process:
   - Entry point (autoloader, hooks, compatibility check)
   - Plugin initialization (container, providers)
   - Provider registration (container configuration)
   - Provider boot (WordPress hooks)
   - Runtime request handling

3. **Key Composition Components Table** - Reference table linking to:
   - Container
   - ServiceProvider
   - RestRouteRegistrar
   - ResponseFormatter
   - SettingsManager

4. **ADR Links** - Direct links to all 5 ADRs:
   - ADR 0001: REST Controller Dependency Resolution
   - ADR 0002: Intent Handler Registration
   - ADR 0003: Intent Classification Strategy
   - ADR 0004: OpenAI Client Architecture
   - ADR 0005: REST Rate Limiting

5. **Link to ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md** - For the improvement roadmap

## How to Verify

1. **View the documentation:**
   ```bash
   cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | head -150
   ```

2. **Verify ADR links are valid:**
   ```bash
   ls docs/adr/000*.md
   ls docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
   ```

3. **View rendered Mermaid diagram:**
   Open `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in a Mermaid-compatible viewer (GitHub, VS Code with Mermaid extension, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

**"A new contributor can trace runtime wiring end-to-end from docs without reading code":**
- The diagram shows the complete flow from `agentwp.php` → `Plugin::init()` → providers → route registrar/formatter → controllers → services/handlers
- Each step is annotated with the relevant file location
- The bootstrap sequence section provides a narrative walkthrough
- Key components table provides quick reference to source files
- ADR links explain the architectural decisions behind each major component

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Diagram complexity**: The Mermaid diagram is detailed; some viewers may have rendering issues with the subgraph layout
- **ADR links are relative**: Links assume viewing from `docs/` directory; GitHub will render them correctly
- **Maintenance**: As the architecture evolves, this documentation will need updates to stay in sync with actual code flow
