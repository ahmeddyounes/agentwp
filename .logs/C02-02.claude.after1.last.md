Only `src/Plugin.php` has code changes. The `.t2/state.json` and untracked files are related to task tracking, not code.

## Self-Review Summary

**Changes made to `src/Plugin.php`:**

1. **Removed 2 method calls from `deactivate()`:**
   - `self::unschedule_action_scheduler_jobs();`
   - `self::cleanup_export_files();`

2. **Removed 2 dead methods:**
   - `unschedule_action_scheduler_jobs()` - 20 lines referencing non-existent `AgentWP\Handlers\BulkHandler`
   - `cleanup_export_files()` - 8-line stub that just returned

3. **Removed 1 guarded call from `__construct()`:**
   - `Handlers\BulkHandler::register_hooks()` call

**Net result:** -43 lines of dead code removed. The changes are minimal and directly address the spec requirement to remove stale references to `BulkHandler`. All removed code was behind `class_exists()` guards for a class that doesn't exist, so there's no functional impact.
