Implemented the refund draft/confirm workflow in a dedicated handler, including transient-backed draft storage, refund amount validation, gateway capability checks, audit logging, and optional notification hooks. The new `src/Handlers/RefundHandler.php` is where the draft is built, stored, and confirmed with `wc_create_refund`, ensuring refunds only execute on explicit confirmation and drafts expire after the configured TTL.

**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Added `src/Handlers/RefundHandler.php` to prepare refund drafts with required fields, calculate remaining refundable amounts, and store drafts in transients with a 10‑minute TTL default.
- Implemented confirmation flow that validates draft/order state, triggers gateway refunds when supported, adds an audit note, and optionally notifies the customer via a filter.
- Included full‑refund restock support (manual restock of all line items) and preserved required draft payload fields.

**How to verify**
- No verification commands provided.

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Restocking is applied only for full refunds (partial refunds skip restock without line‑item selection).
- Customer notification is off by default and relies on the `agentwp_refund_notify_customer` filter to enable sending.
