Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added Chart.js + react-chartjs-2 dependencies and rebuilt `ChartCard` to render line/bar/doughnut charts with tooltips, PNG export, and screen-reader data tables.
- Wired a new analytics section inside the Command Deck modal with period selection and three responsive charts (trend, comparison, category breakdown).
- Added supporting styles for chart layout, accessibility helpers, and export button disabled state.

How to verify:
- `cd react && npm install`
- `cd react && npm run dev`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Currency formatting is fixed to USD; consider wiring to store currency settings.
- If you want light mode for the full Command Deck UI, align global theming with the chart auto theme.
