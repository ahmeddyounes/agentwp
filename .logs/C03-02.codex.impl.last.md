**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Added `ToolSuggestionProvider` and wired `AbstractAgenticHandler` to surface tool suggestions directly from handler tool lists.
- Updated `Engine`/`FunctionRegistry` to derive default suggestions from handlers and filter them against the `ToolRegistry`, with the service provider passing the registry through.
- Added unit coverage for derived/filtered suggestions and refreshed documentation to reflect the tool-driven strategy.

**How to verify**
- Not run (no verification commands provided).
- Optional: `vendor/bin/phpunit --filter FunctionRegistryTest`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Suggestions are now filtered to registered tools; extensions that only used legacy hooks without registering tool schemas may see fewer suggestions.
- Custom handlers that do not implement `ToolSuggestionProvider` will no longer receive default suggestions unless they use the legacy hooks.
