Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Moved React components into `react/src/components` and updated `react/src/main.tsx` to load from the new path.
- Updated React configs to point at `src/components` (TS paths/include, Vite/Vitest aliases + coverage, Tailwind content, ESLint file globs).
- Updated test imports to the new component locations.

How to verify:
- `npm --prefix react run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix react run build`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Verification commands not run locally.
