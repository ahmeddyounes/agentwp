The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary:

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### New Test Files
1. **`tests/e2e/ui-load.spec.js`** (170 lines) - Comprehensive tests for UI mounting and assets loading:
   - `UI Mount and Assets Loading` - Tests mount node rendering, agentwpSettings injection, shadow DOM mounting, ES module loading, and CSS loading
   - `Settings Fetch on Mount` - Tests settings API fetch on load, theme preference application, and demo mode flag
   - `Command Deck UI Integration` - Tests button accessibility and Cmd+K shortcut
   - `Intent Submit Flow via UI` - Tests command deck portal and intent submission readiness

2. **`tests/e2e/woocommerce-mount.spec.js`** (121 lines) - Tests for WooCommerce screen integration:
   - `WooCommerce Screen Mount Node` - Tests mount node on orders, products, settings pages, agentwpSettings availability, theme attribute, and Cmd+K shortcut
   - `WooCommerce Order Detail Integration` - Tests mount node on single order and product edit pages

### Modified Files
3. **`tests/e2e/command-deck.spec.js`** - Updated to work with shadow DOM:
   - Uses new helper functions (`waitForAppMount`, `openCommandDeck`, `shadowQuery`)
   - Tests command deck opening via keyboard, portal root existence, and input accessibility

4. **`tests/e2e/helpers/wp.js`** - Added new helper functions:
   - `waitForAppMount(page, timeout)` - Waits for React app to mount in shadow DOM
   - `shadowQuery(page, selector)` - Queries elements within the AgentWP shadow DOM
   - `openCommandDeck(page)` - Opens command deck via Cmd+K/Ctrl+K shortcut

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run only the new/modified UI tests
npx playwright test ui-load.spec.js woocommerce-mount.spec.js command-deck.spec.js

# Run tests in headed mode to observe
npx playwright test --headed ui-load.spec.js
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Tests require running WordPress environment** - These tests need a WordPress instance with WooCommerce active at the configured `AGENTWP_BASE_URL`

2. **Shadow DOM timing** - Some tests wait for shadow DOM to mount; if the React app loading is slow, timeouts may need adjustment

3. **WooCommerce dependency** - The `woocommerce-mount.spec.js` tests depend on WooCommerce plugin being active; they'll fail if WC is not installed

4. **API key validation** - Tests using `TEST_API_KEY` may need a valid OpenAI key in CI environments if the backend validates keys
