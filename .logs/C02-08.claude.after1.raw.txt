This cleans up dead code and satisfies the acceptance criteria that no unused orphan classes remain.","session_id":"e822a5c8-74c0-4e1a-bce1-8e600132445f","total_cost_usd":0.265401,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":22840,"cache_read_input_tokens":186186,"output_tokens":559,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":22840}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":559,"cacheReadInputTokens":186186,"cacheCreationInputTokens":22840,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.24982799999999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":14993,"outputTokens":116,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.015572999999999998,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"c91ade48-68e4-4c1e-82be-2d943b87df04"}
