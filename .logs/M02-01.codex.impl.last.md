Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added intent engine core with classifier, context builder, session memory, function registry, and handlers in `src/Intent/Engine.php`, `src/Intent/IntentClassifier.php`, `src/Intent/ContextBuilder.php`, `src/Intent/MemoryStore.php`, `src/Intent/FunctionRegistry.php`, `src/Intent/Handler.php`, `src/Intent/Intent.php`, and `src/Intent/Handlers/*.php`
- Wired the engine into the REST intent endpoint, including prompt/input validation and handler responses in `src/Rest/IntentController.php`

How to verify
- No verification commands were provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Rule-based intent matching in `src/Intent/IntentClassifier.php` may need tuning for edge cases.
- Session-based memory in `src/Intent/MemoryStore.php` depends on sessions being available in the hosting environment.
