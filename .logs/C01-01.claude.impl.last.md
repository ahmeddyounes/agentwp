All documentation links are valid. Let me provide the final summary.

---

**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**

1. **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Updated the "Where Things Live" table to emphasize `src/Rest/` as the **canonical location** for REST controllers with namespace `AgentWP\Rest`. Added explicit statement that all new controllers must be added here.

2. **docs/DEVELOPER.md** - Made two updates:
   - Changed overview to remove ambiguity about `src/API/` and clearly state `src/Rest/` as the canonical location
   - Added new section "Adding a new REST endpoint (core development)" with:
     - Clear canonical location specification (`src/Rest/`, `AgentWP\Rest` namespace)
     - Note about legacy controllers in `src/API/`
     - Step-by-step guide for adding new endpoints
     - Controller conventions

3. **.plans/C01-01.md** - Updated spec file with implementation summary

**How to verify:**

```bash
# Check the changes
grep -n "Canonical" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md docs/DEVELOPER.md

# Verify documentation links are valid
composer run docs:check-links

# View the new section in DEVELOPER.md
grep -A 10 "Adding a new REST endpoint" docs/DEVELOPER.md
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**

- **Legacy migration:** `HistoryController` and `ThemeController` still exist in `src/API/`. A future task should migrate these to `src/Rest/` to fully consolidate the codebase.
- **Base class location:** The `RestController` base class remains in `src/API/`. This is acceptable since it's shared infrastructure, but could be moved to a more neutral location like `src/Rest/Base/` or kept where it is.
- **No code changes:** This task only documents the decision. No actual controller migration was performed, which is consistent with the spec's scope.
