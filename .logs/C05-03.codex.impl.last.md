Added an admin-only diagnostics REST endpoint that returns health, recent REST logs, rate-limit status, config flags, and search index state, then wired it into routing, OpenAPI, docs, and a unit test to validate the payload shape.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added `src/Rest/DiagnosticsController.php` with `/agentwp/v1/diagnostics` and structured diagnostics payload.
- Registered the new controller in `src/Plugin/RestRouteRegistrar.php`.
- Updated `docs/openapi.json` schemas/paths and `docs/API.md` to document the endpoint.
- Added `tests/Unit/Rest/DiagnosticsControllerTest.php` for payload structure coverage.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- If you want frontend types/client updated, regenerate React OpenAPI types to include `/diagnostics`.
- Consider adding an e2e test for admin-only access behavior if needed.
