Standardized transient key segments by centralizing session/draft/search backfill prefixes in `AgentWPConfig` and wiring those constants into the transient key builders, keeping the actual key strings unchanged so cleanup still works.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added cache prefix constants for sessions, drafts, and search backfill in `src/Config/AgentWPConfig.php` to make transient naming conventions explicit.
- Updated transient key construction to use the new constants in `src/Infrastructure/PhpSessionHandler.php`, `src/Infrastructure/TransientDraftStorage.php`, and `src/Search/Index.php`, preserving existing key formats.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.
