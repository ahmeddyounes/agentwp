The changes are correct.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Updated `docs/architecture-inventory.md` to reconcile it with the current codebase state:

1. **Title changed**: "Stranded Subsystems" → "Subsystem Integration Status"
2. **Status changed**: "Active" → "Completed" 
3. **All 7 subsystems updated** to reflect their actual status:
   - **AI Client Components**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Files deleted" (confirmed `src/AI/Client/` directory doesn't exist)
   - **Scorer Registry**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Integrated in runtime" (verified wiring in `IntentServiceProvider.php:156-195`)
   - **Rate Limiter Service**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Integrated in runtime" (verified `check_rate_limit_via_service()` in `RestController.php:147`)
   - **Retry Executor**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Integrated in runtime" (verified usage in `OpenAIClient.php:100-130`)
   - **ServiceResult DTO**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Widely adopted" (verified 34+ files using it)
   - **EmailContextBuilder**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Deleted" (confirmed file doesn't exist)
   - **OrderSearch Pipeline**: Now marked as "COMPLETED - Integrated in runtime" (verified wiring in `ServicesServiceProvider.php:122-196`, monolithic service deleted)

4. **All file references verified** to point to existing paths
5. **Summary table updated** with implementation locations and current status
6. **Removed obsolete sections**: Migration steps, Owner Tasks, Epics (all completed)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Check that updated doc is valid markdown
cat docs/architecture-inventory.md

# Verify all referenced paths exist
ls src/Intent/Classifier/ScorerRegistry.php
ls src/API/RateLimiter.php
ls src/Contracts/RateLimiterInterface.php
ls src/Retry/RetryExecutor.php
ls src/DTO/ServiceResult.php
ls src/Services/OrderSearch/PipelineOrderSearchService.php

# Verify deleted paths don't exist
ls src/AI/Client/          # Should fail
ls src/Context/EmailContextBuilder.php  # Should fail
ls src/Services/OrderSearchService.php  # Should fail
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None identified**: The document now accurately reflects the codebase reality. All referenced ADRs (0003, 0004, 0005) and the Architecture Improvement Plan exist and remain valid references.
- **Minor consideration**: If future work resurrects EmailContextBuilder or adds new stranded subsystems, this document should be updated accordingly.
