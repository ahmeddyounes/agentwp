Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added local command history/favorites storage, most-used tracking, and a HistoryPanel UI with re-run/star/delete/clear actions plus a response star button in `react/src/App.jsx` and `react/components/HistoryPanel.jsx`.
- Extended success action cards to optionally render a star toggle in `react/components/cards/SuccessCard.jsx`.
- Added REST backup endpoints for history/favorites and registered the controller in `src/API/HistoryController.php` and `src/Plugin.php`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- None provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- No automated verification was run (no format/lint/test commands supplied).
- Server-side history endpoints are in place; wire optional sync in the UI if desired.
