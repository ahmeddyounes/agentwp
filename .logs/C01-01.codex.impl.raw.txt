**Planning initial approach**

I'm starting by reading the plan to understand requirements before implementing the spec using shell commands to read files.

# C01-01 — Fix docs link check

Ensure all markdown links under `docs/` resolve (create missing targets or update broken relative links). Run `composer run docs:check-links` and iterate until it passes.

**Running composer docs link check**

Documentation Link Checker
==================================================

Scanning docs/ for markdown files...
Found 25 markdown files

Checked 59 links in 7 files

--------------------------------------------------

All links are valid.

thinking
**Confirming no changes needed**

All tests already pass and documentation links resolve correctly, so no code changes are required. I'll provide a final confirmation with the docs link check command and mark the task as done.
