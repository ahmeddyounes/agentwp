The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary:

---

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Created ADR 0008** (`docs/adr/0008-tool-execution-architecture.md`):
   - Documents the decision to use **Approach B: Schema Classes + Handler Executors**
   - Explains the architecture: tool schemas (`FunctionSchema`) define the interface, handlers (`ToolExecutorInterface`) implement execution
   - Includes architecture diagram showing the flow from schemas → registry → handlers → AI client
   - Provides a complete **recipe for adding a new tool** with 4 clear steps
   - Lists design principles, consequences, and alternatives considered
   - References all relevant source files and related ADRs

2. **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md**:
   - Added new section **1.2) Tool Execution Architecture** with:
     - Mermaid diagram showing tool flow
     - Key components table
     - Quick reference for adding new tools
   - Added ADR 0008 to the ADR list in two places (lines ~156 and ~916)
   - Also added missing ADR 0007 reference for completeness

**How to verify:**
```bash
# View the new ADR
cat docs/adr/0008-tool-execution-architecture.md

# Check ARCHITECTURE.md changes
git diff docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

# Verify ADR is properly linked
grep -n "0008" docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- The ADR documents the existing architecture rather than prescribing a new one. This ensures consistency with what's already in the codebase.
- Contributors now have one clear recipe for adding tools (the 4-step process in both ADR and ARCHITECTURE.md).
- No code changes were required since this was a documentation task.
- Consider adding a migration guide if there are any tools not following this pattern.
