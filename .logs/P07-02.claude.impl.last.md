**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

Added a new `release-artifacts` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that validates release-critical artifacts on every PR. The job:

1. **Sets up the build environment** - Installs PHP dependencies (production mode) and builds frontend assets exactly like the release workflow
2. **Creates a dry-run release package** - Uses the same rsync command with all exclusions as the release workflow
3. **Validates UI build manifest** - Checks that `assets/build/.vite/manifest.json` exists (proves frontend build succeeded)
4. **Validates asset directories** - Ensures:
   - Built assets directory exists at `assets/build/assets/`
   - At least one JavaScript file is present
   - Build entry point `index.html` exists
5. **Checks for forbidden folders** - Fails if any of these are found in the package:
   - `node_modules` (anywhere in the tree)
   - `.git`
   - `tests`
   - `react` (source directory)
   - `.github`

## How to verify

1. Push a PR to trigger the CI workflow and observe the `release-artifacts` job
2. Locally simulate validation:
   ```bash
   # Build frontend
   npm ci --prefix react && npm --prefix react run build
   
   # Create test package
   mkdir -p dist/package/agentwp
   rsync -a --exclude '.git' --exclude 'react' --exclude 'node_modules' --exclude '**/node_modules' --exclude 'tests' --exclude '.github' ./ dist/package/agentwp/
   
   # Check manifest exists
   test -f dist/package/agentwp/assets/build/.vite/manifest.json && echo "✓ Manifest exists"
   
   # Check for forbidden folders
   find dist/package/agentwp -type d -name "node_modules" | grep -q . && echo "✗ node_modules found" || echo "✓ No node_modules"
   ```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Risk**: The job mirrors the release workflow's rsync excludes. If the release workflow changes its excludes, this job should be updated to match.
- **Follow-up**: Consider extracting the rsync excludes into a shared script or file to keep them in sync between CI and release workflows.
- **Note**: The job runs independently from the `php` and `node` jobs, so all three run in parallel on PRs.
