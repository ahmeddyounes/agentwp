Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Trimmed the Unreleased notes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` so it only reflects “No changes yet.”
- Updated deprecation/version references in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` to align with 0.2.0, added the active IntentClassifier deprecation, and corrected the “Removed In” versions.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands were provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Code deprecation strings in `src/Intent/IntentClassifier.php` still reference 2.0.0/3.0.0; consider aligning them with the updated docs/versioning (likely part of C02-05).
- I noticed unrelated modified files in the worktree (`.t2/state.json`, `.logs/C02-03.gitcommit.txt`); let me know how you want to handle those.
