Reading the spec + handoff, then I’ll implement the required changes and sanity-check behavior.

I’m going to audit current transient/cache key usage across the plugin, then standardize on a single prefix and update cleanup paths accordingly.

I’m going to inspect the current transient/cache key implementations and cleanup logic, then refactor to a single predictable key convention and confirm uninstall/deactivation still clears everything.

I’m going to inspect the modified cache/transient-related files and align them to a single key convention, then ensure deactivation/uninstall cleanup still removes everything.

I’m going to finish standardizing the remaining hard-coded `agentwp_` transient prefix to use `Plugin::TRANSIENT_PREFIX`, then rerun PHPUnit.
