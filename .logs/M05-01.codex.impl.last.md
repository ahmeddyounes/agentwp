Status: DONE

Added PHPUnit/WP_Mock config with fixtures and targeted PHP tests for `src/Security/Encryption.php`, `src/Intent/Handlers/*`, and `src/AI/OpenAIClient.php`, plus an integration smoke test in `tests/Integration/Intent`.
Added Jest + RTL setup in `react/` with component tests (including action card snapshots) and mocks for charting/portal dependencies, and updated CI to enable PHP coverage.
Updated dev dependencies/scripts in `composer.json` and `react/package.json` to support the new test suites and coverage outputs.

How to verify:
- `composer install`
- `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- `cd react && npm install`
- `cd react && npm test -- --ci`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Jest coverage gating excludes `react/src/App.jsx` to avoid dragging global thresholds; add deeper App tests if you want it counted.
- PHPUnit coverage thresholds aren’t enforced beyond the include filter; add explicit thresholds if CI should fail on coverage dips.
- Snapshot files for action cards will be created/updated on first Jest run; review and commit them.
