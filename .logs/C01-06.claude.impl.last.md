## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

Updated `tests/Integration/Architecture/BoundariesTest.php` to strengthen controller boundary tests:

1. **Added `CONTROLLER_DIRECTORIES` constant** (line 322) - Defines the canonical location(s) for REST controllers (`['Rest']`), making it easy to add new locations during transition if needed.

2. **Added `test_all_controllers_are_in_canonical_location()` test** (lines 332-367) - Scans the entire `src` directory for any file that looks like a controller (by filename or content) and verifies it's in the canonical location. This ensures adding a new controller outside `src/Rest` will fail the test.

3. **Added `looksLikeController()` helper method** (lines 375-395) - Identifies controllers by checking:
   - Filename ends with `Controller.php`
   - File content extends `WP_REST_Controller` or `RestController`

4. **Updated `restControllerFilesProvider()`** (lines 523-555) - Now uses the `CONTROLLER_DIRECTORIES` constant and only includes files ending with `Controller.php` (excluding `RestController.php` base class).

5. **Strengthened `test_rest_controllers_extend_base_controller()`** (lines 408-445) - Now strictly requires controllers to extend `RestController` (the project's base class), not just any class ending with "Controller". Also fails if a controller has no parent class.

## How to verify

```bash
# Run all boundary tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter BoundariesTest

# Test that a controller outside src/Rest fails
mkdir -p src/Infrastructure/Test
echo '<?php namespace AgentWP\Infrastructure\Test; use AgentWP\Rest\RestController; class BadController extends RestController {}' > src/Infrastructure/Test/BadController.php
./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter test_all_controllers_are_in_canonical_location
# Should fail with message about controller outside canonical location
rm -rf src/Infrastructure/Test
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The `looksLikeController()` method uses a regex check on file content which could have false positives (e.g., comments mentioning `extends RestController`), but the combination with filename check mitigates this.
- **Follow-up**: If new canonical controller directories are added during a transition, update the `CONTROLLER_DIRECTORIES` constant to include both old and new locations.
