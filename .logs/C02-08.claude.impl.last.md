The changes are confirmed. The two orphan files have been deleted:
- `src/Context/EmailContextBuilder.php` 
- `src/DTO/ServiceResult.php`

---

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes
Removed two unused "orphan" value object classes that had no integration path:

1. **Deleted `src/DTO/ServiceResult.php`** - A standardized result object for service operations that was never imported or used anywhere in the codebase.

2. **Deleted `src/Context/EmailContextBuilder.php`** - An email drafting context builder for WooCommerce orders that was never imported or used anywhere in the codebase.

3. **Removed `src/Context/` directory** - The directory became empty after removing EmailContextBuilder.php, so it was also removed.

## How to verify

```bash
# Verify files are removed
ls src/DTO/ServiceResult.php 2>&1 || echo "ServiceResult.php: removed"
ls src/Context/ 2>&1 || echo "Context directory: removed"

# Verify no references remain (should show only docs/logs files, not source)
grep -r "ServiceResult" --include="*.php" src/
grep -r "EmailContextBuilder" --include="*.php" src/

# Check git status
git status
```

## Risks / follow-ups
- **Low risk**: These classes were completely orphaned with no references in source code, tests, or configuration files. Removal has no impact on functionality.
- **Documentation cleanup**: The classes are still mentioned in `docs/architecture-inventory.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`. Consider updating these docs if they need to reflect current state.
