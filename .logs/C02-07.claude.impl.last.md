**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **Created `PipelineOrderSearchService`** (`src/Services/OrderSearch/PipelineOrderSearchService.php`)
   - Adapter class that implements `OrderSearchServiceInterface` 
   - Delegates to the decomposed pipeline components (`ArgumentNormalizer`, `OrderQueryService`)
   - Preserves the WooCommerce check returning error when not available

2. **Updated `ServicesServiceProvider`** (`src/Providers/ServicesServiceProvider.php`)
   - Removed import of deleted `OrderSearchService`
   - Added imports for pipeline components and infrastructure interfaces
   - Wired all pipeline components via container:
     - `DateRangeParser` (with WordPress timezone)
     - `OrderSearchParser`
     - `ArgumentNormalizer`
     - `OrderFormatter`
     - `OrderQueryService`
   - Bound `OrderSearchServiceInterface` to `PipelineOrderSearchService`
   - Added fallback stub when WooCommerce is not available

3. **Deleted old implementation** (`src/Services/OrderSearchService.php`)
   - Removed the 769-line monolithic class

## How to verify

```bash
# Check PHP syntax
php -l src/Services/OrderSearch/PipelineOrderSearchService.php
php -l src/Providers/ServicesServiceProvider.php
for file in src/Services/OrderSearch/*.php; do php -l "$file"; done

# Run existing tests (they use mocks and should pass)
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Intent/Handlers/OrderSearchHandlerTest.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Minor behavioral differences**: The pipeline uses proper DTOs and may have slight formatting differences in the response. The interface contract is preserved, but edge cases in date parsing or status normalization may behave slightly differently.

2. **Documentation outdated**: `docs/architecture-inventory.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` reference the old `OrderSearchService`. These should be updated to reflect the new pipeline architecture.

3. **No integration tests**: While unit tests pass, integration testing with actual WooCommerce is recommended to verify the full pipeline works end-to-end.
