Implemented the AgentWP settings REST API plus a WordPress-components React admin UI so settings persist, API keys validate, and usage stats render from the backend.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added REST routes for settings, API key validation, and usage stats in `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`.
- Expanded defaults, options, and REST registration in `src/Plugin.php` to support new settings, usage stats, and admin asset deps.
- Replaced the admin placeholder UI with a React settings screen using `wp.components`/`wp.apiFetch` in `assets/agentwp-admin.js`.
- Styled the settings layout and cards in `assets/agentwp-admin.css`.
- Updated uninstall cleanup for new options in `uninstall.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No automated verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- OpenAI validation depends on external `/v1/models` availability and network access.
- Usage stats are stubbed (zeroed) and `last_sync` updates on fetch; real tracking still needed.
- API keys are encrypted at rest but decryption/rotation paths aren’t wired yet for future OpenAI calls.
