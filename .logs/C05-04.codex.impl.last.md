Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Expanded secret redaction patterns (API keys, Basic auth, cookies, JWTs, PEM blocks) and added more sensitive key names in `src/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLogger.php`.
- Hardened nested context sanitization to handle list-style arrays without key-type errors in `src/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLogger.php`.
- Added unit tests covering Basic auth, JWTs, cookie headers, and list-based nested context in `tests/Unit/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLoggerTest.php`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLoggerTest.php`

Risks / follow-ups
- Broader redaction rules may mask more log detail than before; confirm that’s acceptable for ops/debugging.
- Tests not run in this session.
