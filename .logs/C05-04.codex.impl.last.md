Added runtime config fields to `agentwpSettings` and wired React to consume them instead of hardcoded constants, so the frontend now aligns with server-defined values for API namespace and limits.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added `apiNamespace`, `historyLimit`, `favoritesLimit`, and `agenticMaxTurns` to script localization in `src/Plugin/AssetManager.php`
- Updated `react/src/api/AgentWPClient.ts` to build base URLs from runtime `apiNamespace`/`restNamespace` without hardcoded defaults
- Replaced hardcoded history/favorites limits in `react/src/utils/constants.ts` and `react/src/stores/useCommandStore.ts` with runtime settings
- Extended `react/src/types/index.ts` and `react/tests/setupTests.ts` to include new settings fields

How to verify (exact commands)
- N/A (no verification commands provided)

Risks / follow-ups
- If `window.agentwpSettings` is missing in non-WP contexts, API base URLs fall back to `/`; ensure mocks or embedding pages provide settings when running React standalone
