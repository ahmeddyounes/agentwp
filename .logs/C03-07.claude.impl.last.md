All 26 tests pass. Task C03-07 is complete.

**Summary of Implementation:**

Created `tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php` with 26 tests verifying:

1. **Container Binding Tests** - Verifies CoreServiceProvider, InfrastructureServiceProvider, and IntentServiceProvider register expected bindings (OptionsInterface, CacheInterface, ClockInterface, AIClientFactoryInterface, Engine, handlers, etc.)

2. **Engine Resolution Tests** - Confirms Engine resolves with all dependencies, receives tagged handlers via `container->tagged('intent.handler')`, and that registries (HandlerRegistry, FunctionRegistry, ToolRegistry) are proper singletons

3. **REST Controller Resolution Tests** - Simulates `RestController::resolve()` and `resolveRequired()` patterns to verify controllers can resolve dependencies from the container

4. **DI Bypass Detection Tests** - Ensures tests will fail if:
   - Handlers are instantiated directly instead of via container
   - Singletons return different instances
   - Required dependencies are missing

The tests fulfill the acceptance criteria: they will fail if a controller/service reintroduces DI bypass by verifying that services are resolved through the container with proper singleton behavior.
