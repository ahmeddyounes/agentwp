The only code change is to `.t2/state.json` which is the task tracking state file - it updated to record C03-02 as done and track the current C03-03 session. This is expected system behavior, not code changes.

## Summary

**Self-review complete.** There are no code changes to review.

The task C03-03 required no implementation because the work was already completed in C03-01. The spec asked to:
- Update `AnalyticsController.php` to resolve `AnalyticsServiceInterface` from container
- Remove concrete fallback instantiation
- Ensure provider wiring always registers the service

All three requirements were already satisfied by commit `507ca24` (C03-01), which:
1. Changed `$this->resolve()` + `new AnalyticsService()` fallback to `$this->resolveRequired()`
2. Removed the unused `AnalyticsService` import
3. The provider was already wiring unconditionally

**Files changed:** Only `.t2/state.json` (tracking metadata, not implementation code)
