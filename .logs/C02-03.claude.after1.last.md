## Summary

Self-reviewed all uncommitted changes for C02-03. The implementation is correct:

**Files Modified (6 source files):**

1. **`src/Plugin/SettingsManager.php`** - Added 6 `DEFAULT_*` constants and updated methods to use them
2. **`src/Plugin.php`** - Option constants now delegate to `SettingsManager`; deprecated docblocks added; default methods delegate to `SettingsManager`
3. **`src/Demo/Mode.php`** - Changed import and all references from `Plugin` to `SettingsManager`
4. **`src/Demo/CLI.php`** - Changed import and references in `enable()` method
5. **`src/Demo/Resetter.php`** - Changed import and references in `reset_settings()` method
6. **`src/Rest/SettingsController.php`** - Changed import and all option/default references

**Review Findings:**
- All PHP syntax is valid
- Backward compatibility preserved - `Plugin::OPTION_*` constants still resolve to same values
- Database option names unchanged - existing installations unaffected
- No magic numbers remain - all defaults use named constants
- Single source of truth achieved - `SettingsManager` is authoritative
