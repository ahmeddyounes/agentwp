Status: DONE

Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to declare 0.2.0 as the authoritative current release, add clear release boundaries, and move the previously “Unreleased” content under the new 0.2.0 section with a versioning note.

How to verify (exact commands): No verification commands specified.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Follow up on aligning `agentwp.php`/`AGENTWP_VERSION` (and optionally `react/package.json`) with the 0.2.0 decision.
