All 345 tests pass. Let me create a summary of the changes.

## Summary

**Status: DONE**

### Summary of Changes

Implemented a unified DraftManager that standardizes draft lifecycle management across all draft-based flows (refund, status, stock).

**New Files Created:**
1. `src/Contracts/DraftManagerInterface.php` - Interface defining the unified draft lifecycle API
2. `src/DTO/DraftPayload.php` - Immutable DTO for standardized draft payload shape
3. `src/Services/DraftManager.php` - Implementation wrapping DraftStorageInterface with standardized logic

**Modified Files:**
1. `src/Services/OrderRefundService.php` - Refactored to use DraftManagerInterface
2. `src/Services/OrderStatusService.php` - Refactored to use DraftManagerInterface
3. `src/Services/ProductStockService.php` - Refactored to use DraftManagerInterface
4. `src/Providers/ServicesServiceProvider.php` - Added DraftManager registration and updated service bindings
5. `tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php` - Added test for ServicesServiceProvider bindings

**Key Standardizations Achieved:**
- **Draft ID generation**: Unified via `DraftManager::create()` which delegates to storage's `generate_id()` with type prefix
- **Storage payload shape**: All drafts now have standardized structure: `{id, type, payload, preview, created_at, expires_at}`
- **TTL handling**: Centralized in DraftManager, reads from SettingsManager and converts minutes to seconds
- **Claim semantics**: Uniform `claim()` method returns `ServiceResult` with `payload` and `preview` data
- **Error handling**: Consistent use of `ServiceResult::draftExpired()` for expired/invalid drafts

### How to Verify

```bash
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/

# Run specific container wiring tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php

# PHP syntax check on new files
php -l src/Contracts/DraftManagerInterface.php
php -l src/DTO/DraftPayload.php
php -l src/Services/DraftManager.php
```

### Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Backward compatibility**: The existing `DraftStorageInterface` is still available and used internally by DraftManager, so any code using it directly will continue to work.

2. **Email draft service**: The `EmailDraftService` uses a different pattern (not using DraftStorageInterface) and was not refactored. This is intentional as email drafts have different requirements.

3. **Integration testing**: While unit tests pass, full integration testing with WooCommerce would verify the end-to-end draft flows work correctly in a live WordPress environment.
