Added a voice POC to the Command Deck by wrapping the Web Speech API, wiring mic controls/transcripts + TTS into the UI, and documenting feasibility, privacy, and compatibility in a dedicated report.

Status: DONE
Summary of changes:
- Added Web Speech API wrappers in `react/src/voice/SpeechRecognition.js` and `react/src/voice/SpeechSynthesis.js` with wake-word gating and safe fallbacks.
- Integrated voice controls, transcript panel, and response TTS button into the Command Deck in `react/src/App.jsx`.
- Documented feasibility, compatibility matrix, accuracy benchmarks, accessibility, and privacy in `docs/voice-mode-report.md`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands specified.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Voice accuracy, wake-word behavior, and Safari/iOS limitations need manual in-browser validation against the benchmark protocol in `docs/voice-mode-report.md`.
- If built assets are required for distribution, regenerate the frontend bundle to update `assets/`.
