Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Implemented clipboard copy actions (plain/HTML/Markdown), mailto generation, and draft history persistence/restore in `react/src/App.jsx`.
- Added an analytics chart section with PNG export at 2x scale via html2canvas in `react/src/App.jsx`.
- Added copy feedback animation styles and the html2canvas dependency in `react/src/index.css` and `react/package.json`.

How to verify
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- `html2canvas` in `react/package.json` must be installed before building.
- Manual check recommended: open the modal, verify copy formats + “Open in Mail,” restore a draft from history, and export the chart PNG.
