All documentation has been updated. Let me provide a summary.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Updated three documentation files to reflect the service layer refactoring from C07-01 through C07-07:

### `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Added new **Section 1.1: Service Layer Architecture** with Mermaid diagram showing the clean architecture pattern
- Documented the **Policy Layer** (`PolicyInterface` / `WooCommercePolicy`) for centralized capability checks
- Documented the **ServiceResult Standard** with all result codes and HTTP status mappings
- Documented **WooCommerce Gateway Abstractions** (refund, order, stock, user gateways)
- Updated **Section 5: Draft-Confirm Data Flow** with:
  - New sequence diagram showing `DraftManager` involvement
  - Documented **Unified Draft Lifecycle** conventions
  - Documented **DraftPayload DTO** structure
  - Updated draft payload example with new structure

### `docs/DEVELOPER.md`
- Added new **Service layer conventions** section with:
  - ServiceResult pattern usage and factory methods table
  - Policy layer injection requirements
  - Gateway abstractions requirements and available gateways table
  - Draft-based operations using `DraftManagerInterface`
  - Testing services with mocks/fakes example

### `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- Added all new components under **Added** section
- Added 6 **BREAKING** changes documenting:
  - ServiceResult as standard return type
  - PolicyInterface for capability checks
  - Gateway interfaces for WooCommerce operations
  - DraftManagerInterface for draft lifecycle
- Added **Migration Guide** with before/after code examples for:
  - ServiceResult pattern
  - Policy layer
  - Gateway abstractions
  - Draft lifecycle

## How to Verify

1. Review the documentation changes:
```bash
git diff docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
git diff docs/DEVELOPER.md
git diff docs/CHANGELOG.md
```

2. Verify documentation matches implementation:
```bash
# Check that documented interfaces exist
ls -la src/Contracts/PolicyInterface.php
ls -la src/DTO/ServiceResult.php
ls -la src/DTO/DraftPayload.php
ls -la src/Services/DraftManager.php
ls -la src/Security/Policy/WooCommercePolicy.php
```

3. Verify unit tests exist as documented:
```bash
ls -la tests/Unit/Services/*Test.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **OpenAPI spec sync**: The `docs/openapi.json` may need updates if REST response schemas changed due to `ServiceResult` adoption. Run `composer run openapi:validate` to check.

2. **Handler migration**: Intent handlers that consume services may need updates to handle `ServiceResult` instead of arrays. The changelog migration guide documents the pattern.

3. **Extension documentation**: Third-party plugins extending AgentWP services will need to follow the new patterns documented in DEVELOPER.md.
