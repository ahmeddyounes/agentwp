**Self-review complete.** The ADR looks good and meets all acceptance criteria from the spec.

**Summary of what I did:**

Created `docs/adr/0004-openai-client-architecture.md` - a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record that:

1. **Makes explicit choices:**
   - Delete unused modular components (`src/AI/Client/*`)
   - Refactor `OpenAIClient` to use `HttpClientInterface` + `RetryExecutor`
   - Keep streaming internal to `OpenAIClient`

2. **Lists concrete refactor steps:** 6 phases with specific actionable items

3. **Addresses migration:** Backward-compatible constructor injection pattern

4. **Documents streaming handling:** Explains why it remains internal with DoS protections

The ADR follows the same format as existing ADRs (0003-intent-classification-strategy.md) with Context, Decision, Consequences, and References sections.
