This is expected system behavior, not code changes.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Self-review complete.** There are no code changes to review.\n\nThe task C03-03 required no implementation because the work was already completed in C03-01. The spec asked to:\n- Update `AnalyticsController.php` to resolve `AnalyticsServiceInterface` from container\n- Remove concrete fallback instantiation\n- Ensure provider wiring always registers the service\n\nAll three requirements were already satisfied by commit `507ca24` (C03-01), which:\n1. Changed `$this->resolve()` + `new AnalyticsService()` fallback to `$this->resolveRequired()`\n2. Removed the unused `AnalyticsService` import\n3. The provider was already wiring unconditionally\n\n**Files changed:** Only `.t2/state.json` (tracking metadata, not implementation code)","session_id":"deb28e6b-298d-49a6-bf9a-8b4e34e7a8ab","total_cost_usd":0.25443750000000004,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":30588,"cache_read_input_tokens":102631,"output_tokens":410,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":30588}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":410,"cacheReadInputTokens":102631,"cacheCreationInputTokens":30588,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.2527505,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":1327,"outputTokens":72,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.001687,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"79c602ae-d7e1-4bff-9e09-f0f2465a42c6"}
