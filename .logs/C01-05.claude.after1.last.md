All references are accurate. The changes are minimal and focused on the spec requirements.

## Summary

**Task C01-05: Update Boot/Composition Docs** - Complete

**Changes made to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`:**

1. **Added Boot/Composition Flow section** with a comprehensive Mermaid diagram showing the 5-phase bootstrap:
   - Bootstrap (`agentwp.php`)
   - Plugin singleton initialization  
   - Service provider registration (5 providers with their registered services)
   - Service provider boot (WordPress hooks)
   - Runtime request flow

2. **Added Bootstrap Sequence (Step-by-Step)** prose explanation with file paths

3. **Added Key Composition Components table** with locations and purposes

4. **Added Architecture Decision Records section** linking to ADRs 0001–0005 with one-line summaries

5. **Added link to ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md** for the roadmap

**No issues found during self-review.** The changes are additive-only (no existing content modified), all referenced files exist, and the documentation accurately reflects the actual codebase structure based on my analysis of `agentwp.php`, `src/Plugin.php`, and the service providers.
