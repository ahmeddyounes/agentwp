# Check all modified documentation files
git diff --stat

# Review ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md status
head -10 docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

```

### Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low risk**: Documentation is now comprehensive but may need updates as code evolves. The ADRs provide stable reference points.

2. **Follow-up consideration**: The WeightedScorerDecorator noted in ADR 0003 is marked as deferred - could be implemented if weight customization is requested.

3. **Follow-up consideration**: The migration script for custom handlers noted in ADR 0002 is marked as optional/deferred tooling.
