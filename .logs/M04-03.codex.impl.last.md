Implemented a global light/dark theme system with CSS variables and a Command Deck toggle, persisting the preference to localStorage and a new user‑meta REST endpoint while applying theme early to avoid flashes and keep charts/cards in sync (`react/src/index.css`, `react/src/App.jsx`, `react/src/theme.js`, `react/src/main.jsx`, `src/API/ThemeController.php`, `src/Plugin.php`).

Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added full theme token palettes, high‑contrast overrides, and Tailwind color mapping so all UI colors come from CSS variables (`react/src/index.css`, `react/tailwind.config.js`).
- Introduced theme state, toggle button, persistence, and chart palette updates tied to the active theme (`react/src/App.jsx`, `react/src/theme.js`, `react/src/main.jsx`).
- Converted card styles/components to inherit theme tokens and avoid forcing dark mode defaults (`react/components/cards/cards.css`, `react/components/cards/BaseCard.jsx`, `react/components/cards/*.jsx`).
- Added REST support for user theme preference plus early theme injection to prevent FOUC (`src/API/ThemeController.php`, `src/Plugin.php`).

How to verify (exact commands)
- `cd react && npm run build`

Risks / follow-ups
- Rebuild and commit `assets/agentwp-admin.js`/`assets/agentwp-admin.css` if this repo expects built assets to be updated from `react/`.
- Manual UI pass recommended to confirm contrast in both themes, including cards, charts, inputs, and high‑contrast mode.
