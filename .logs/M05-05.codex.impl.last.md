Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added environment compatibility checks with admin notices and tightened PHP requirement to 8.0 in `agentwp.php`, `composer.json`, `src/Compatibility/Environment.php`.
- Added no-cache REST headers for caching plugin compatibility in `src/Plugin.php` plus REST/jQuery Playwright checks in `tests/e2e/rest-api.spec.js`, `tests/e2e/jquery-compat.spec.js`.
- Introduced compatibility scripts and documentation in `scripts/compatibility/*`, `docs/compatibility.md`, and a GitHub Actions matrix workflow in `.github/workflows/compatibility.yml`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `WP_VERSION=6.6 WC_VERSION=9.0 PHP_VERSION=8.3 bash scripts/compatibility/run-matrix.sh`
- `AGENTWP_KEEP_ENV=1 WP_VERSION=6.6 WC_VERSION=9.0 PHP_VERSION=8.3 bash scripts/compatibility/run-extended.sh`
- `npx playwright test tests/e2e/jquery-compat.spec.js`

Risks / follow-ups:
- The matrix workflow assumes `wp-env` honors `WP_ENV_CORE` and `WP_ENV_PHP_VERSION`; confirm in CI and adjust if needed.
- Premium conflict plugins (WooCommerce Subscriptions, WPML, WP Rocket) require zip URLs via env vars for full coverage.
- If caching plugins override REST headers, consider adding explicit cache exclusions for `/wp-json/agentwp/v1/*` in site config.
