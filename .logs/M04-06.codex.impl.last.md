Status: NEEDS-REVIEW

Implemented shadow-root mounting and scoped styling for the command deck, with the modal now portaled into the shadow root and theme/hotkey handling adapted for shadow DOM.
- `react/src/main.jsx`: attach to `#agentwp-root`, inject inline Tailwind CSS into the shadow root, and pass `shadowRoot`/`portalRoot`/`themeTarget` into the app.
- `react/src/App.jsx`: apply theme to the host, use composed-path targets for the hotkey guard, trap focus using the shadow-root active element, and portal the modal via `createPortal`.
- `react/src/index.css`: scope theme variables to `:host`, move base background to `.agentwp-app`, remove Google font import, and add a system font stack plus shadow-root theme-transition selectors.
- `react/tailwind.config.js`, `react/index.html`: update font stacks and dev root id to `agentwp-root`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- None (no automated verification commands provided).

Risks / follow-ups:
- Manual QA still needed across the listed themes and admin customization plugins.
- Confirm `#agentwp-root` is rendered on target admin pages so the shadow mount always occurs.
