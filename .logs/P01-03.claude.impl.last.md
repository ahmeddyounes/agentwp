**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

Modified `react/vite.config.ts` to:

1. **Added `base: './'`** - Sets relative base path for plugin-relative URLs, ensuring assets load correctly regardless of WordPress installation path

2. **Added `build.outDir`** - Outputs to `../assets/build/` (resolves to `assets/build/` from project root)

3. **Added `build.emptyOutDir: true`** - Cleans the output directory before each build

4. **Added `build.manifest: true`** - Generates `.vite/manifest.json` for runtime asset enqueueing

5. **Added explicit `rollupOptions.input`** - Specifies entry point for deterministic builds

6. **Added asset file naming patterns** - `entryFileNames`, `chunkFileNames`, `assetFileNames` with content hashes for cache busting

## How to verify

```bash
cd react && npm run build
```

Expected output:
- `assets/build/` directory created with compiled assets
- `assets/build/.vite/manifest.json` with asset mapping
- `assets/build/index.html` with relative `./` prefixed asset paths
- All JS/CSS files have content hashes (e.g., `App-CGDzqxQX.js`)
- Running build twice produces identical hashes (deterministic)

## Risks / follow-ups

- The `assets/build/` directory should be added to `.gitignore` if not already (build artifacts shouldn't be committed)
- PHP enqueueing code will need to read `manifest.json` to resolve hashed asset paths at runtime (likely P01-04 or later task)
