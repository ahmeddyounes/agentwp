**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Removed all stale references to `BulkHandler` from `src/Plugin.php`:

1. **Removed `unschedule_action_scheduler_jobs()` method** (lines 107-127) - This method referenced `AgentWP\Handlers\BulkHandler` which doesn't exist
2. **Removed `cleanup_export_files()` method** (lines 129-137) - This was a stub related to BulkHandler
3. **Removed calls to removed methods** from `deactivate()` - Removed calls to `unschedule_action_scheduler_jobs()` and `cleanup_export_files()`
4. **Removed BulkHandler init call** from `__construct()` - Removed the guarded `Handlers\BulkHandler::register_hooks()` call

Note: `HandlerServiceProvider` was already removed in C02-01 (no references found in source code).

## How to Verify

```bash
# Verify no invalid references remain in source
rg "HandlerServiceProvider|BulkHandler" src/

# Verify PHP syntax is valid
php -l src/Plugin.php

# Verify all PHP files have valid syntax
find src -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \; | grep -v "No syntax errors"
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The removed code was guarded by `class_exists()` checks, so it was already non-functional dead code
- **No follow-up needed**: The BulkHandler feature referenced in M07-01 handoff was never committed to the repository (only exists in logs/plans), so removing these references cleans up incomplete implementation remnants
