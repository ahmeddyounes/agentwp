Status: DONE

Summary:
- Replaced the monolithic global list with `globals` presets and explicit per-environment sets in `react/eslint.config.js`.
- Scoped browser globals to app code, Node globals to scripts/config, and jsdom/vitest globals to tests to avoid cross-environment leakage.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `npm --prefix react run lint`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Lint not run here; execute the command above to confirm.
