All three checks pass:
- **PHPUnit**: 100 tests, 336 assertions, all passing
- **PHPStan**: No errors
- **PHPCS**: No errors (only deprecation warnings about the tool itself, not code issues)

---

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- Added `get_option()` function polyfill to `tests/bootstrap.php` to fix test failures in `ContainerWiringTest`. The `SystemClock::withWordPressTimezone()` method calls `get_option()` which wasn't available in the test environment.

**How to verify:**
```bash
composer run phpunit   # Should show OK (100 tests, 336 assertions)
composer run phpstan   # Should show [OK] No errors
composer run phpcs     # Should show no errors (deprecation warnings are expected)
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- The `get_option()` polyfill in bootstrap.php returns the default value, which means tests using `SystemClock::withWordPressTimezone()` will always get UTC timezone. This is acceptable for unit tests.
- The deprecation warnings from PHPCS are about the tool scanning CSS/JS files and are not related to this refactor.
