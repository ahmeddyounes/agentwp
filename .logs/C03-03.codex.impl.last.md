Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Filtered default function suggestions in `src/Intent/Engine.php` against registered tool schemas and executors, with post-filter sanitization.
- Wired the tool dispatcher into `Engine` construction in `src/Providers/IntentServiceProvider.php` so suggestions reflect executable tools.
- Added a regression test covering filtered default mappings in `tests/Unit/Intent/EngineDefaultMappingTest.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Intent/EngineDefaultMappingTest.php`

Risks / follow-ups:
- If a handler uses a custom dispatcher that isn’t passed into `Engine`, suggestions may be filtered more aggressively than intended.
