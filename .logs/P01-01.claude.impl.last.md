The document is well-structured. The decision record has been inserted after the "Recommended direction" section, and the existing "Work items (Option B)" section follows naturally, providing the detailed implementation steps.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Updated `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` with the frontend consolidation decision:

1. **Marked Option B as SELECTED** — The Vite React app (`react/`) is the single supported frontend.

2. **Added a Phase 1 Decision Record** containing:
   - The decision and date (2026-01-17)
   - Rationale (5 points: feature completeness, architecture quality, testing infrastructure, type safety, build tooling)
   - Migration strategy in 3 phases:
     - Phase 1.1: Wire Vite output into WordPress
     - Phase 1.2: Fallback behavior during transition
     - Phase 1.3: Legacy removal
   - Runtime surfaces documentation
   - Compatibility notes for WordPress environments
   - Removal timeline table

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the decision record
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md | head -160

# Confirm "SELECTED" marker is present
grep -n "SELECTED" docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md

# Confirm decision date is recorded
grep -n "2026-01-17" docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Immediate follow-up (P01-02 or similar)**: Wire Vite build output into `AssetManager.php` — the decision is documented but the actual integration work remains.

2. **Mount point mismatch**: Current legacy bundle mounts to `#agentwp-admin-root` while React app expects `#agentwp-root`. This needs resolution in the next phase.

3. **Release workflow**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` needs updating to build and package the Vite output correctly.
