Implemented a full order status draft/confirm handler so updates are validated, previewed, and only applied after explicit confirmation.

Summary of changes:
- Added `src/Handlers/OrderStatusHandler.php` to prepare single and bulk status update drafts with previews, irreversible-change warnings, and a 50-order cap.
- Confirm flow applies WooCommerce status updates, writes `[AgentWP]` audit notes, and suppresses emails when `notify_customer` is false.
- Drafts are stored in transients with the configured TTL and reject invalid statuses or no-op transitions.

Status: DONE

How to verify:
- (no commands provided)

Risks / follow-ups:
- Confirmation still requires a caller (tool/REST wiring) to invoke `confirm_status_update` with a `draft_id` if that plumbing isn’t already in place.
