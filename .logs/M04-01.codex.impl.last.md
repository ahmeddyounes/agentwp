Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added a searchable index with incremental backfill, save hooks, and a new `/agentwp/v1/search` REST endpoint for products, orders, and customers. (`src/Search/Index.php`, `src/Rest/SearchController.php`, `src/Plugin.php`)
- Implemented a debounced typeahead dropdown in the Command Deck input with icons, keyboard navigation, highlighting, and structured query insertion. (`react/src/App.jsx`)

How to verify (exact commands)
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Index backfill runs incrementally on admin page loads; very large catalogs may rely on fallback queries until backfill completes.
- Fulltext indexing depends on DB support; fallback `LIKE` queries may be slower on extremely large datasets.
