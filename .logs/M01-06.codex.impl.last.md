Implemented the Command Deck modal in the React dev UI with Tailwind styling, keyboard/focus handling, and a simple REST flow to `/agentwp/v1/intent`.

Status: DONE
Summary of changes:
- Replaced the UI in `react/src/App.jsx` with the Command Deck modal, global hotkey/admin bar triggers, focus trap, session persistence, skeleton loading, and markdown rendering.
- Added Tailwind + PostCSS setup and dark Linear-style visuals/animations in `react/src/index.css`, `react/tailwind.config.js`, and `react/postcss.config.js`.
- Added Tailwind/PostCSS tooling and `react-markdown` to `react/package.json`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `cd react && npm install`
- `cd react && npm run dev`

Risks / follow-ups:
- The admin bar trigger relies on `#wp-admin-bar-agentwp` or `[data-agentwp-command-deck]`; confirm the final WP admin bar markup matches.
- Token cost only displays when the API returns `token_cost`; the current REST response does not include it yet.
