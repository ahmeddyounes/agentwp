**Self-review summary:**

The uncommitted changes are correct and minimal:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/Context/EmailContextBuilder.php` | **Deleted** - 1,023 lines removed (unused orphan class) |
| `src/DTO/ServiceResult.php` | **Deleted** - 231 lines removed (unused orphan class) |
| `.t2/state.json` | Modified (task state tracking - expected) |

**Verification performed:**
- ✅ Only the two orphan files were deleted from `src/`
- ✅ No other source files were modified
- ✅ Pure deletions - no code additions
- ✅ Classes had zero references in source code, tests, or config
- ✅ Empty `src/Context/` directory was cleaned up

**What I did:** Removed two completely orphaned value object classes (`ServiceResult` and `EmailContextBuilder`) that had no integration path in the codebase, per the task spec. This cleans up dead code and satisfies the acceptance criteria that no unused orphan classes remain.
