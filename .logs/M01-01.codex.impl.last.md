Implemented the AgentWP plugin scaffold with bootstrap hooks, Composer PSR-4 autoloading, and admin menu/asset gating; added default option lifecycle handling and uninstall cleanup to satisfy M01-01.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added the main plugin bootstrap with activation/deactivation hooks and autoload fallback in `agentwp.php`.
- Introduced core plugin class for menu registration, scoped asset enqueues, and options/transient cleanup in `src/Plugin.php`, plus uninstall cleanup in `uninstall.php`.
- Added Composer autoload config and required directory placeholders/assets in `composer.json`, `assets/agentwp-admin.js`, `assets/agentwp-admin.css`, `assets/index.php`, `includes/index.php`, `languages/index.php`, `src/index.php`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Placeholder admin assets are minimal; React build output still needs to be wired into `assets/`.
- WordPress Plugin Check not run in this environment.
