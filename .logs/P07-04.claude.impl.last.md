The implementation is already complete. Let me summarize what I found:

## Summary

The OpenAPI validation is **already properly configured** to fail CI builds on spec errors. No changes were needed.

**What's in place:**

1. **`scripts/openapi-validate.php`** (lines 194, 258, 262):
   - Exits with code `1` if the spec structure is invalid (missing `openapi`, `info`, or `paths` fields, or invalid JSON)
   - Exits with code `1` if there's drift between code annotations and the OpenAPI spec
   - Exits with code `0` only when all endpoints are synchronized

2. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** (lines 73-80):
   - The "Validate OpenAPI spec" step runs `php scripts/openapi-validate.php`
   - When the script exits with code 1, the step fails and fails the entire `php` job
   - This prevents PRs with invalid OpenAPI from passing CI

**Verified behavior:**
- Invalid spec structure → exit code 1 (tested with `{"invalid": true}`)
- Missing endpoints from spec → exit code 1 (tested by removing `/agentwp/v1/health`)
- All endpoints synchronized → exit code 0 (tested with current valid spec)

---

**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:** No code changes required. The existing implementation already enforces OpenAPI validation in CI with proper exit codes.

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Verify current validation passes
php scripts/openapi-validate.php

# Test failure case (temporarily break spec, then restore)
mv docs/openapi.json /tmp/backup.json && echo '{}' > docs/openapi.json && php scripts/openapi-validate.php; mv /tmp/backup.json docs/openapi.json
```

**Risks / follow-ups:** None. The acceptance criteria (invalid OpenAPI cannot merge) is already met by the existing implementation.
