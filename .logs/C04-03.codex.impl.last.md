Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added `agentwp_register_tools` action during `IntentServiceProvider` boot to expose tool registry/dispatcher for third‑party registration.
- Documented the new hook in `docs/EXTENSIONS.md` and refreshed IntentServiceProvider line references.
- Added integration coverage for registering a schema and executor via the new hook.

How to verify
- `composer run phpunit -- tests/Integration/Intent/ToolRegistrationHookTest.php`

Risks / follow-ups
- `IntentServiceProvider::boot()` now eagerly resolves `ToolRegistryInterface`/`ToolDispatcherInterface`; booting without required service bindings could throw.
- Tests not run in this change set.
