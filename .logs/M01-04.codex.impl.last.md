Implemented a shared REST base controller with auth, rate limiting, schema validation, standardized responses, and logging; added intent/health endpoints and an OpenAPI spec to document the API.

**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Added base REST controller with auth, rate limiting, schema validation, response formatting, and transient logging in `src/API/RestController.php`.
- Updated settings/usage/api-key routes to use the base controller and JSON schema validation in `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`.
- Added new `/intent` and `/health` endpoints in `src/Rest/IntentController.php` and `src/Rest/HealthController.php`, and wired them with response normalization/logging in `src/Plugin.php`.
- Generated OpenAPI spec covering the REST endpoints in `docs/openapi.json`.

**How to verify**
- No format/lint/test commands provided.

**Risks / follow-ups**
- `/intent` currently returns a stub response (no AI processing yet) in `src/Rest/IntentController.php`.
- Settings/api-key schema validation is strict; unknown fields will be rejected in `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`.
- No automated tests were run (none specified).
