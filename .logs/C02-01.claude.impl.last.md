**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

Consolidated plugin bootstrap responsibilities in `src/Plugin.php` by removing legacy/duplicate methods that were superseded by the `src/Plugin/*` managers and service provider wiring:

### Removed unused imports (7)
- `AdminMenuManager`, `AssetManager`, `ResponseFormatter`, `RestRouteRegistrar`, `SettingsManager`, `ThemeManager`, `HandlerServiceProvider`

### Removed dead property (1)
- `$menu_hook` - no longer used since menu registration is handled by `AdminMenuManager`

### Removed dead methods (9)
- `register_menu()` - duplicated by `AdminMenuManager::addMenu()` (wired via `CoreServiceProvider::boot()`)
- `render_admin_page()` - duplicated by `AdminMenuManager::renderDefaultPage()`
- `enqueue_admin_assets()` - duplicated by `AssetManager::enqueueAdminAssets()` (wired via `CoreServiceProvider::boot()`)
- `output_theme_attribute()` - duplicated by `AssetManager::outputThemeAttribute()`
- `get_user_theme_preference()` - duplicated by `ThemeManager::getUserTheme()`
- `register_rest_routes()` - duplicated by `RestRouteRegistrar::registerRoutes()` (wired via `RestServiceProvider::boot()`)
- `format_rest_response()` - duplicated by `ResponseFormatter::formatResponse()` (wired via `RestServiceProvider::boot()`)
- `is_agentwp_route()` - duplicated by `ResponseFormatter::isAgentWPRoute()`
- `is_woocommerce_screen()` - duplicated by `AssetManager::isWooCommerceScreen()`

### Removed stale comments
- Removed notes about hooks now being registered by providers (the code is now self-documenting)

### Preserved intact
- `activate()` - plugin activation handler
- `deactivate()` - plugin deactivation handler
- `delete_transients()`, `unschedule_action_scheduler_jobs()`, `cleanup_export_files()` - deactivation helpers
- `get_default_settings()`, `get_default_usage_stats()` - settings defaults used by activation
- All option constants and provider registration logic

**Net result:** 266 lines removed, single code path now exists for menu/assets/REST wiring through the service providers.

## How to verify

```bash
# Syntax check
php -l src/Plugin.php

# Run tests
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Low risk:** The removed methods were never hooked (no `add_action` calls referenced them) and no external code called them
- **Follow-up:** Consider removing `cleanup_export_files()` which is a no-op stub (just returns)
- **Follow-up:** The `HandlerServiceProvider` import was present but the provider was never instantiated - confirmed removed
