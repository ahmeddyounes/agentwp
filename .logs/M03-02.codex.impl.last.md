Implemented a new email drafting handler that builds OpenAI prompts from order context, generates HTML + plain-text drafts with template variable replacement, and stores them for retrieval/editing in transients (`src/Handlers/EmailDraftHandler.php`).

**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Added `src/Handlers/EmailDraftHandler.php` with AI + fallback draft generation, EmailContextBuilder-driven prompts, placeholder cleanup, and 30‑minute transient storage/retrieval/edit flows.

**How to verify (exact commands)**
- None provided.

**Risks / follow-ups**
- OpenAI requests and WooCommerce data paths were not exercised locally; validate with a real order and API key to confirm tone variance and tracking/product mentions.

Next steps (optional):
1) Provide an order ID + API key so I can outline a manual smoke test for draft/create/update retrieval flows.
