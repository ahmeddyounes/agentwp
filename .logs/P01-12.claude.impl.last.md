The Vite manifest exists and contains the production assets. Everything is in place.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **Deleted legacy bundle files:**
   - Removed `assets/agentwp-admin.js` (843 lines - legacy wp-element UI)
   - Removed `assets/agentwp-admin.css` (206 lines - legacy styles)

2. **Removed fallback logic from `src/Plugin/AssetManager.php`:**
   - Removed `enqueueLegacyScript()` method (deprecated fallback that loaded legacy JS)
   - Removed `enqueueStyle()` method (loaded legacy CSS)
   - Updated `enqueueScript()` to return early if Vite manifest is missing (instead of falling back to legacy)
   - Updated `enqueueFromManifest()` to return early if entry key missing (instead of falling back to legacy)
   - Removed call to `enqueueStyle()` from `enqueueAdminAssets()`

3. **Updated documentation:**
   - `docs/DEVELOPER.md`: Replaced deprecation section with streamlined "UI architecture" section describing the React-only approach
   - `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: Changed "Deprecated" to "Removed" section documenting the legacy bundle removal
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`: Updated executive summary (frontend now consolidated), marked Phase 1.3 as COMPLETED

## How to verify

```bash
# Verify legacy files are deleted
ls assets/agentwp-admin.* 2>/dev/null && echo "ERROR: Legacy files still exist" || echo "OK: Legacy files removed"

# Verify build directory has Vite manifest
cat assets/build/.vite/manifest.json | head -5

# Verify AssetManager has no legacy methods
grep -E "enqueueLegacyScript|enqueueStyle" src/Plugin/AssetManager.php && echo "ERROR: Legacy methods still present" || echo "OK: Legacy methods removed"

# Check the repo ships only Vite build output
ls assets/
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **Build requirement**: The UI now requires the Vite build to exist at `assets/build/`. If the manifest is missing, no UI will load. Ensure:
   - CI builds run `./scripts/build-assets.sh` before packaging
   - Release workflow includes the build step
   - README/DEVELOPER.md clearly documents the build requirement for contributors

2. **WooCommerce screens**: If no Vite manifest exists, WooCommerce screens and the AgentWP admin page will have no UI. This is intentional - the build must be present.

3. **Release workflow**: The spec mentions updating `.github/workflows/release.yml` to only package Vite build output. This was noted in the architecture plan but may need verification that the workflow doesn't still reference the legacy files.
