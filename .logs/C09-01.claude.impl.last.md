All types pass. The implementation is complete.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **Installed `openapi-typescript`** (v7.10.1) as a dev dependency in `react/package.json`

2. **Added `generate:types` npm script** to `react/package.json`:
   ```json
   "generate:types": "openapi-typescript ../docs/openapi.json -o src/types/api.ts"
   ```

3. **Generated `react/src/types/api.ts`** containing TypeScript types for:
   - All API paths (`/agentwp/v1/intent`, `/agentwp/v1/settings`, etc.)
   - All component schemas (`IntentRequest`, `SettingsResponse`, `ErrorResponse`, etc.)
   - Request/response types with proper optional/required markers

4. **Documented the workflow** in `docs/DEVELOPER.md` under the "OpenAPI spec" section with:
   - Command to generate types
   - Usage example for importing types
   - Workflow for keeping types in sync

## How to verify

```bash
cd react
npm run generate:types    # Regenerates src/types/api.ts
npm run typecheck         # Validates generated types compile
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Generated types should be committed**: The `api.ts` file should be committed to the repo for CI/dev consistency (as specified in the acceptance criteria)
- **Consider adding to pre-commit**: Could add `npm run generate:types` to pre-commit hooks if `openapi.json` changes
- **Consider CI step**: A CI step could verify types are up-to-date by regenerating and checking for diff
