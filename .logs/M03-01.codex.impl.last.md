Added an `EmailContextBuilder` to assemble structured order context for email drafting, including plugin-aware tracking data, customer stats, recent notes, and issue detection to meet the M03-01 spec.

**Status**
- DONE

**Summary**
- Created `src/Context/EmailContextBuilder.php` to build order/customer/shipping/payment/notes context with tracking integrations and issue flags.

**How to verify**
- No verification commands provided.

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Tracking URL generation is best-effort and depends on tracking plugin metadata availability.
- Guest customer total spent relies on WooCommerce helper functions; fallback totals are capped for performance.
