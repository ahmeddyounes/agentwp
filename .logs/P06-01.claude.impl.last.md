The implementation is complete. Let me generate the summary.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### New Files Created:
1. **`src/Contracts/LoggerInterface.php`** - Minimal PSR-3 inspired logger contract with 8 log levels (emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug). Each method accepts a message and optional context array.

2. **`src/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLogger.php`** - Implementation that:
   - Uses WooCommerce's `wc_get_logger()` when available
   - Falls back to PHP's `error_log()` when WooCommerce is not active
   - Sanitizes all messages and context to prevent leaking secrets:
     - OpenAI API keys (sk-*, sk-proj-*)
     - Bearer tokens
     - Authorization headers
     - Passwords, secrets, tokens
     - Credit card patterns
     - Context keys containing sensitive terms

3. **`tests/Unit/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLoggerTest.php`** - 13 unit tests covering:
   - Interface implementation
   - Secret pattern sanitization (OpenAI keys, Bearer tokens, passwords, credit cards)
   - Context key sanitization
   - Nested context sanitization
   - Multiple secrets in one message
   - Preservation of non-sensitive data

### Modified Files:
1. **`src/Providers/InfrastructureServiceProvider.php`** - Added `registerLogger()` method that registers `LoggerInterface` as a singleton bound to `WooCommerceLogger`

2. **`stubs/woocommerce.php`** - Extended `WC_Logger` stub with all 8 log level methods for PHPStan

3. **`tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php`** - Added 3 integration tests verifying:
   - `LoggerInterface` resolves to `WooCommerceLogger`
   - Logger is registered as singleton
   - Controllers can resolve the logger

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run all tests (759 tests should pass)
./vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run logger-specific tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLoggerTest.php

# Run container wiring tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php

# Run PHPStan
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=512M

# Run PHPCS
./vendor/bin/phpcs src/Contracts/LoggerInterface.php src/Infrastructure/WooCommerceLogger.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Secret patterns may not cover all edge cases** - The regex patterns are comprehensive but may not catch all possible secret formats. Consider reviewing and expanding patterns as new secret types are introduced.

2. **Performance consideration** - Sanitization runs regex on every log message. For high-volume logging, this could have performance implications. The current implementation should be fine for typical WordPress/WooCommerce usage.

3. **Future integration** - Core code currently uses direct `wc_get_logger()` calls in some places (e.g., `UsageTracker.php`). These could be refactored to use `LoggerInterface` for consistency and testability.
