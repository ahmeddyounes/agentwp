Verification complete. All 7 subsystems mentioned in the spec have:
- **AI client components** - Decision: DELETE, Owner: Epic D / ADR 0004 Phase 1
- **Scorer registry** - Decision: INTEGRATE, Owner: Epic C / Phase 3
- **Rate limiter service** - Decision: INTEGRATE, Owner: Epic E / Phase 5
- **Retry executor** - Decision: INTEGRATE, Owner: Epic D / Phase 4
- **ServiceResult** - Decision: DEFER, Owner: Epic F / Phase 6
- **EmailContextBuilder** - Decision: DEFER, Owner: Future
- **OrderSearch pipeline** - Decision: INTEGRATE, Owner: Epic F

---

**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**
- Created `docs/architecture-inventory.md` - A comprehensive inventory document listing all 7 stranded subsystems with:
  - Location and files for each subsystem
  - Current status (unused, registered but unused, etc.)
  - Analysis of why it's stranded
  - Explicit decision (DELETE, INTEGRATE, or DEFER)
  - Rationale with ADR references where applicable
  - Owner task/epic assignments
  - Migration steps for integration decisions
  - Summary table for quick reference
  - Links to related ADRs and architecture documents

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check the document exists and has content
cat docs/architecture-inventory.md | head -50

# Verify all subsystems are covered (should show 7 sections)
grep -c "^### [0-9]" docs/architecture-inventory.md

# Verify all have decisions
grep -c "^\*\*Decision:\*\*" docs/architecture-inventory.md

# Verify all have owner tasks
grep -c "^\*\*Owner Task:\*\*" docs/architecture-inventory.md
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None for this documentation task
- The actual implementation work is tracked in the Architecture Improvement Plan phases and ADRs
- High-priority actions (DELETE AI client components, INTEGRATE scorer registry) should be tackled first per the priority column
