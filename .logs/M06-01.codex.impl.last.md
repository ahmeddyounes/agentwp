Status: DONE

Implemented the full M06-01 documentation suite and aligned the codebase with it by adding extension hooks, OpenAPI endpoint annotations, and missing inline docs. The new docs live in `README.md` and the `docs/` suite, while the hooks and annotations are in the REST/intent controllers and engine to support custom intent handlers and the OpenAPI spec.

Summary of changes:
- Built the documentation set and OpenAPI reference in `README.md`, `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER.md`, `docs/FAQ.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/openapi.json`, plus placeholder screenshots in `docs/screenshots/command-deck.svg` and related SVGs.
- Added extension hooks and OpenAPI annotations in `src/Intent/Engine.php`, `src/Rest/IntentController.php`, `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`, `src/Rest/SearchController.php`, `src/Rest/HealthController.php`, `src/API/HistoryController.php`, and `src/API/ThemeController.php`.
- Added missing PHP DocBlocks and React JSDoc for public APIs/components in `src/AI/Functions/*.php`, `src/Intent/Handlers/*.php`, `src/API/RestController.php`, `react/src/App.jsx`, and `react/components/*.jsx`.

How to verify:
- No automated verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- The new screenshots are SVG placeholders; replace with real UI captures when available.
- OpenAPI spec is updated manually; consider adding a generation script if you want strict sync enforcement.
