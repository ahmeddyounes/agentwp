**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **Fixed PHP issues:**
   - Fixed unused `$args` parameter warning in `ServicesServiceProvider.php:117` (anonymous class implementing `OrderSearchServiceInterface`)
   - Fixed PHPStan errors for unused constructor parameters in `DemoClient.php` by removing the unused `$model` and `$intent_type` properties and adding a PHPStan ignore rule

2. **Updated PHPStan config (`phpstan.neon`):**
   - Added ignore rule for `constructor.unusedParameter` in `DemoClient.php` (intentional for interface compatibility)

3. **Updated `docs/CHANGELOG.md`:**
   - Documented all breaking changes from consolidation
   - Listed new additions (`ApiKeyStorage`, `DemoClient`, architecture inventory)
   - Documented changed behaviors (single-path architecture, option consolidation, order search pipeline, demo mode)
   - Listed fixes and removals

4. **Updated `docs/DEVELOPER.md`:**
   - Added "Single-path bootstrap architecture" section explaining managers and providers
   - Added "API key management" section documenting `ApiKeyStorage` usage
   - Added "Demo mode behavior" section clarifying credential rules
   - Added "Order search pipeline" section documenting the modular architecture

## How to verify

```bash
# PHP checks
composer run phpunit      # 55 tests pass
composer run phpcs        # No errors (only deprecation warnings about JS scanning)
composer run phpstan      # No errors

# React/JS checks
cd react
npm run typecheck         # No errors
npm run lint              # No errors  
npm run test              # 14 tests pass
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **None critical** - All baseline checks pass
- The PHPCS deprecation warnings about JS scanning are upstream issues with the WordPress VIP coding standards, not our code
- The React test coverage is ~40% overall but that's not a blocking issue for this hygiene task
