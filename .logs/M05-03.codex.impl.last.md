Added REST nonce enforcement and tightened logging while introducing VIP PHPCS/PHPStan configs and a full security policy to meet audit readiness expectations.

Status: NEEDS-REVIEW

Summary of changes
- `src/API/RestController.php`: require REST nonces for state-changing requests and log only query/body keys (no IP/PII).
- `src/Search/Index.php` and `src/Handlers/AnalyticsHandler.php`: use `%i` placeholders for table identifiers and safer table lookups.
- `src/Plugin.php`: suppress PHPCS false positive for safe inline script output.
- `composer.json`, `phpcs.xml`, `phpstan.neon`: add VIP PHPCS/PHPStan tooling and configs.
- `SECURITY.md`: document security architecture, data handling, and review/release checklists.

How to verify (exact commands)
- `composer install`
- `vendor/bin/phpcs`
- `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`
- `composer audit`
- `npm install`
- `npm audit`

Risks / follow-ups
- Dependency audits are not run yet; execute the release checklist in `SECURITY.md`.
- PHPCS/PHPStan were not run here; verify no warnings locally.
- Nonce enforcement now blocks state-changing REST calls without `X-WP-Nonce`; confirm any non-admin clients include a valid nonce.
