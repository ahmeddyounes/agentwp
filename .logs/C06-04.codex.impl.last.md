Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Centralized uninstall logic in `src/Plugin/Uninstall.php`, expanded option cleanup, and added multisite-aware site iteration helpers.
- Updated `uninstall.php` to delegate to the new uninstall helper.
- Documented multisite activation/upgrade/uninstall expectations in `docs/MULTISITE.md` and expanded FAQ guidance in `docs/FAQ.md`.
- Added unit tests for uninstall option key coverage and multisite helper behavior in `tests/Unit/Plugin/UninstallTest.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Uninstall still iterates all sites on multisite; large networks may take longer (documented in `docs/MULTISITE.md`).

Next steps:
1) Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` if you want to exercise the new unit tests.
