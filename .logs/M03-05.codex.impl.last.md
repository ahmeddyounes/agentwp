Implemented customer LTV profiling with batched order aggregation and wired the customer lookup intent to return those profiles.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added `src/Handlers/CustomerHandler.php` to compute totals, AOV, favorites, LTV projection, health status (via `agentwp_customer_health_thresholds`), and recent order summaries with guest email lookup.
- Updated `src/Intent/Handlers/CustomerLookupHandler.php` to extract email/ID from prompts and return CustomerHandler results.

How to verify:
- Not provided (no format/lint/test commands listed).

Risks / follow-ups:
- LTV is a simple 12‑month projection based on order frequency and AOV; adjust the formula or included statuses if you want a different horizon.
- Customer ID + email inputs prioritize ID; merge both if you want guest and registered orders combined.
