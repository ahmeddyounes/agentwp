## Self-Review Summary

All changes look correct and consistent with task C02-05. Here's what was implemented:

### New Files
1. **`src/Demo/DemoCredentials.php`** - Defines explicit credential rules for demo mode with security guarantee that real API keys are never used when demo mode is enabled
2. **`src/Demo/DemoClient.php`** - Implements `OpenAIClientInterface` with stubbed responses for use when no demo API key is configured
3. **`tests/Unit/Demo/DemoCredentialsTest.php`** - 7 tests covering credential selection logic
4. **`tests/Unit/Demo/DemoClientTest.php`** - 7 tests covering stubbed response behavior

### Modified Files
1. **`src/AI/AIClientFactory.php`** - Updated to use `DemoCredentials` for deterministic client selection based on demo mode state
2. **`src/Providers/InfrastructureServiceProvider.php`** - Registered `DemoCredentials` in DI container and updated factory instantiation
3. **`docs/DEMO.md`** - Added comprehensive documentation of demo mode credential rules

### Verification
- All 55 tests pass
- PHPCS shows no errors or warnings
- PHP syntax is valid
