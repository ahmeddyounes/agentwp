The only file I created for this task is `docs/adr/0005-rest-rate-limiting.md`. The other untracked files (`.logs/`, `.plans/`, `.t2/handoff/`) are pre-existing context/handoff files, not part of my implementation.

## Summary

**Self-review completed.** I made the following corrections during review:

1. **Fixed interface accuracy**: The original ADR showed `checkAndIncrement()` being called on `RateLimiterInterface`, but this method only exists on the concrete `RateLimiter` class. I updated the code example to use the interface methods `check()` and `increment()` separately.

2. **Added clarifying note**: Added a note explaining that the concrete `RateLimiter` class provides an atomic `checkAndIncrement()` method for high-throughput scenarios when atomicity is required.

3. **Updated table and bullet points**: Fixed references to `checkAndIncrement()` to clarify it's a concrete class feature, not an interface method.

**Final deliverable**: `docs/adr/0005-rest-rate-limiting.md` (252 lines) - an Architecture Decision Record that:
- Chooses Option A (injected `RateLimiterInterface`) as the single rate limiting strategy
- Documents Retry-After behavior (HTTP 429, `retry_after` seconds until window reset)
- Specifies storage keys (`{prefix}{user_id}` format with lock keys)
- Provides testing strategy with `FakeRateLimiter` examples
- Includes a 3-phase migration path from static method to DI service
