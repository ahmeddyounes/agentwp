Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added wp-env setup plus test-only mu-plugins for OpenAI VCR and WooCommerce/intent test endpoints in `tests/wp-env/mu-plugins/agentwp-openai-vcr.php` and `tests/wp-env/mu-plugins/agentwp-test-tools.php`.
- Implemented Playwright integration suite covering REST, OpenAI VCR, WooCommerce flows, intent flow, and Command Deck interactions in `tests/e2e/*.js`, with helpers in `tests/e2e/helpers/wp.js`.
- Added OpenAI fixtures in `tests/fixtures/openai` and test runner scaffolding in `package.json`, `playwright.config.cjs`, and `docs/integration-tests.md`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `npm install`
- `npm run wp-env:start`
- `npm run test:e2e`

Risks / follow-ups:
- The Command Deck Playwright test assumes the Command Deck UI is bundled and rendered on `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=agentwp`; if the current asset build doesn’t include it, update the build pipeline or selectors.
- If Playwright browsers aren’t installed locally, run `npx playwright install` before `npm run test:e2e`.
