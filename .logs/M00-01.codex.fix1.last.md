I can’t find `.plans/M00-01.md` or `.t2/handoff/M00-01.md` in this repo. The only available specs/handoffs are `M01-01` to `M01-03`, and there are no references to `M00-01`.

How would you like to proceed?
1) Point me to the correct spec/handoff paths for M00-01
2) Confirm you meant one of `M01-01`, `M01-02`, or `M01-03`
