The ADR has been created successfully. Let me verify the acceptance criteria from the spec:

**Spec Requirements:**
> "ADR names the primary classifier implementation and extension hook contract"

**Verification:**
1. **Primary classifier implementation named:** Yes - `ScorerRegistry` is explicitly designated as "the canonical intent classification mechanism" in the Decision section
2. **Extension hook contract defined:** Yes - Two extension points are documented:
   - `agentwp_intent_scorers` filter with full contract (input, output, timing)
   - `agentwp_intent_classified` action with parameters

3. **Weights/thresholds from AgentWPConfig:** Yes - Section "Weights and Thresholds from AgentWPConfig" explains how they should apply (WeightedScorerDecorator pattern for weights, confidence calculation for thresholds)

4. **Testing strategy:** Yes - Comprehensive section covering unit tests, integration tests, extension point tests, and property-based testing

---

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- Created `docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md` - An Architecture Decision Record that:
  - Designates `Intent\Classifier\ScorerRegistry` as the primary (canonical) intent classification implementation
  - Deprecates `IntentClassifier` with a clear timeline (supported through v2.x, deprecated in v2.0, removed in v3.0)
  - Defines `agentwp_intent_scorers` filter for registering custom scorers with full contract specification
  - Defines `agentwp_intent_classified` action for post-classification hooks
  - Explains how `AgentWPConfig` weights should apply via `WeightedScorerDecorator` pattern
  - Explains how confidence thresholds should be used for UI/UX decisions (with note that implementation is deferred)
  - Provides comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests per scorer, integration tests, extension tests, property-based tests)
  - Includes migration checklists for both core and third-party developers

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Check file exists and is readable
cat docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md

# Verify key sections are present
grep -E "^## (Context|Decision|Consequences|Testing Strategy)" docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md

# Verify primary implementation is named
grep -i "ScorerRegistry.*canonical" docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md

# Verify extension hooks are documented
grep -E "agentwp_intent_(scorers|classified)" docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
1. **Implementation work pending:** The ADR documents the decision but the actual code changes (updating `IntentServiceProvider`, adding deprecation notices, implementing `WeightedScorerDecorator`) are tracked in the Migration Checklist and should be separate tasks
2. **Confidence interface extension:** The ADR notes that exposing classification confidence requires extending `IntentClassifierInterface` - this is a potential breaking change for v2.0
3. **Third-party impact:** Plugins directly instantiating `IntentClassifier` will need migration guidance when deprecation notices are added
