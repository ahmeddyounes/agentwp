**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to add a new "Run PHPStan" step in the `php` job (lines 60-71). The step:
- Runs after PHPUnit and before OpenAPI validation
- Checks if PHPStan is installed (`vendor/bin/phpstan` exists)
- Checks if a PHPStan config file exists (`phpstan.neon` or `phpstan.neon.dist`)
- Executes `composer run phpstan` which includes the memory limit (`-d memory_limit=1G`) already defined in composer.json

## How to Verify

1. Create a PR and observe the CI workflow - PHPStan should run as part of the `php` job
2. Locally verify the script will run:
   ```bash
   composer run phpstan
   ```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The step follows the same defensive pattern as other CI steps (skips gracefully if tools/config missing)
- **Potential follow-up**: If PHPStan finds existing errors in the codebase, they will block PRs until fixed. Run `composer run phpstan` locally first to ensure the codebase is clean before merging this change.
