Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Implemented OpenAI usage tracking with the new `src/Billing/UsageTracker.php`, hooked logging into `src/AI/OpenAIClient.php`, and updated the `/usage` REST response in `src/Rest/SettingsController.php`.
- Added budget-limit settings and refreshed usage UI in `assets/agentwp-admin.js` with supporting styles in `assets/agentwp-admin.css`.
- Added a Command Deck status bar (session tokens, session cost, monthly total, budget warnings) plus usage/settings fetches in `react/src/App.jsx`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No automated verification commands were provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- If `assets/` is expected to be generated from `react/`, rebuild to keep `assets/agentwp-admin.js` and `assets/agentwp-admin.css` in sync with `react/src/App.jsx`.
- Usage tracking only records OpenAI calls that go through `OpenAIClient` and supply an `intent_type`; any future LLM paths should use that client to keep analytics complete.
