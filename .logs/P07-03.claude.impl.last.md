The implementation is complete and verified. The OpenAPI type generation drift check:

1. **Exists in CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` lines 108-117)
2. **Runs in the React/Node job** as specified in the task
3. **Uses `npm run generate:types`** to regenerate types from `docs/openapi.json`
4. **Diffs `src/types/api.ts`** to detect changes
5. **Fails with clear instructions** if types are out of sync

---

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- The OpenAPI type generation drift check was already implemented in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` as part of commit P07-02
- The check runs in the `node` job before TypeScript checking, linting, and testing
- It regenerates types from `docs/openapi.json` → `react/src/types/api.ts` and fails if git detects any differences

**How to verify:**
1. Local test (drift detection works):
   ```bash
   cd react
   echo "// drift test" >> src/types/api.ts
   npm run generate:types
   git diff --exit-code src/types/api.ts  # Should show diff and exit non-zero
   git checkout src/types/api.ts  # Restore
   ```

2. Local test (types are in sync):
   ```bash
   cd react
   npm run generate:types
   git diff --exit-code src/types/api.ts  # Should exit 0, no output
   ```

3. CI will automatically run this check on every PR

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None identified. The implementation correctly uses `git diff --exit-code` which is a standard, reliable approach for detecting file changes in CI.
