All tests pass. Let me provide a summary of the implementation:

---

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. `src/Intent/Handlers/BaseHandler.php`
- Added `@deprecated 2.0.0` annotation to `getIntent()` method with migration instructions
- Added `@see` reference to `\AgentWP\Intent\Attributes\HandlesIntent`
- Added `triggerDeprecationWarning()` private helper method that:
  - Only triggers in WP_DEBUG mode
  - Uses static tracking to avoid duplicate warnings per handler class
  - Uses WordPress `_doing_it_wrong()` when available, falls back to `trigger_error()`
  - Includes migration suggestions

### 2. `src/Intent/Engine.php`
- Added `triggerLegacyMethodWarning()` private helper method for legacy discovery detection
- Added deprecation comment annotations to both fallback paths (`getSupportedIntents()` and `getIntent()`)
- Warnings are triggered when Engine falls back to legacy methods (only in WP_DEBUG mode)
- Warning messages reference the ADR document for migration instructions

### 3. `docs/adr/0002-intent-handler-registration.md`
- Marked Phase 1 (Soft Deprecation) as ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Added details about how deprecation warnings work
- Updated migration checklist to mark "Add deprecation logging for legacy discovery paths" as complete

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run PHP syntax check
php -l src/Intent/Handlers/BaseHandler.php
php -l src/Intent/Engine.php

# Run tests
php vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage

# To test deprecation warnings manually (in WP_DEBUG mode):
# 1. Create a handler without #[HandlesIntent] attribute
# 2. Register it via the agentwp_intent_handlers filter
# 3. Check debug.log for deprecation notices
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Handlers using legacy methods will see warnings in WP_DEBUG mode** - This is intentional to encourage migration, but could generate log noise during development.

2. **The `getIntent()` method in BaseHandler will trigger a deprecation warning every time it's called** - The warning is deduplicated per-class, but if handlers that already use `#[HandlesIntent]` also call `getIntent()` internally, they'll see warnings. The current core handlers (e.g., `OrderSearchHandler`) use attributes, so they won't trigger warnings during intent discovery.

3. **Follow-up tasks documented in ADR:**
   - Update DEVELOPER.md with new handler registration guide
   - Create migration script for custom handlers (optional tooling)
   - Migrate all core handlers to use attributes (some already do)
