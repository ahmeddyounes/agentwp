Updated the API client to normalize `{success,data,error}` envelopes into consistent `ApiResponse` shapes and added typed error extraction for hooks; added MSW coverage for success/error envelopes.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Normalized response parsing and error shaping in `react/src/api/AgentWPClient.ts`, including envelope detection, retry-after handling, and service-unavailable mapping.
- Added `getApiError` helper and surfaced typed API errors in hooks (`react/src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`, `react/src/hooks/useUsage.ts`, `react/src/hooks/useSearch.ts`, `react/src/hooks/useHealthCheck.ts`).
- Aligned MSW error mocks with the canonical envelope and added API client tests (`react/tests/mocks/handlers.ts`, `react/tests/api/AgentWPClient.test.ts`).
