Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Simplified the `finally` block in `src/Infrastructure/RateLimiting/RateLimiter.php` to always release the lock without an always-true condition, preserving fail-open behavior.

How to verify (exact commands):
- Not provided (no format/lint/test commands specified)

Risks / follow-ups:
- Low risk; logic change is limited to lock release. No automated checks were run.
