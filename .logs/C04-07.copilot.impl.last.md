I’ll read the spec and handoff, then implement the required code changes and sanity-check behavior.

I’m going to inspect the existing Engine/tool-dispatcher code and current test harness, then add an integration PHPUnit test using a fake AI client that returns tool calls.

Adding an integration test that runs the full Engine → agentic handler → ToolDispatcher loop with a fake AI client that returns tool_calls, asserting validation + dispatch + JSON tool message wiring.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added `tests/Integration/Intent/ToolExecutionPathTest.php` covering Engine → AbstractAgenticHandler → ToolDispatcher execution.
- Tests validate: tool call dispatch, JSON serialization of tool results, and schema-based argument validation error shape.

How to verify (exact commands):
```bash
cd /Users/ahmedyounis/Documents/Projects/agentwp
./vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite integration
# optional full run
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Risks / follow-ups:
- Integration tests rely on the repo’s REST schema validation stubs; if those stubs diverge from WP core behavior, validation-edge coverage may be imperfect.
- PHPUnit output includes deprecation notices from `IntentClassifier`; not caused by this change but could be cleaned up later.
