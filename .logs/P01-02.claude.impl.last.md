**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

1. **`src/Plugin/AdminMenuManager.php`** (line 98):
   - Changed the mount node ID from `agentwp-admin-root` to `agentwp-root`
   - This aligns with what the React app (`react/src/main.tsx`) expects to find

2. **`assets/agentwp-admin.js`** (line 815):
   - Updated the `boot()` function to look for `agentwp-root` first, with fallback to `agentwp-admin-root`
   - This maintains backward compatibility during migration if both IDs are temporarily present

## How to verify

1. Navigate to the AgentWP admin page in WordPress (WooCommerce → AgentWP)
2. Inspect the DOM and confirm there's a `<div id="agentwp-root" class="agentwp-admin"></div>` element
3. The React Command Deck should mount reliably when triggered (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)
4. The WordPress settings panel should also load correctly

```bash
# Run PHP code sniffer
composer phpcs src/Plugin/AdminMenuManager.php

# Run E2E tests (if WordPress environment is running)
npm run test:e2e
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The fallback for `agentwp-admin-root` in `agentwp-admin.js` can be removed in a future cleanup once migration is complete
- If there are any external integrations or tests that target the old `agentwp-admin-root` ID, they would need updating
