Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added the card component library with BaseCard and the required variants in `react/components/cards`, plus an export barrel in `react/components/cards/index.js`.
- Implemented shared styling, theme variables (dark/light), focus/hover states, and entry animation in `react/components/cards/cards.css`.
- Built sortable + paginated data table behavior in `react/components/cards/DataTableCard.jsx`.

How to verify (exact commands)
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups
- Components are not yet wired into the React app; import them where needed in `react/src` when you want to render the cards.
- Light mode requires passing `data-theme="light"` via the `theme` prop on each card or a wrapper.
