**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Created alignment test (`react/tests/utils/error-code-alignment.test.ts`)
- New test file that validates frontend error code mapping covers all backend `AgentWPConfig` error codes
- Contains 20 tests:
  - 18 parameterized tests (one for each backend error code) verifying each code has a frontend mapping
  - 1 test ensuring no orphaned frontend codes exist without backend counterparts
  - 1 test ensuring all error messages are non-empty strings
- Clear documentation explaining how to add new error codes and keep them in sync

### 2. Updated frontend error mapping (`react/src/utils/error.ts`)
Added 2 missing error codes to `AGENTWP_ERROR_MESSAGES`:
- `agentwp_validation_error`: "Validation failed. Please check your input and try again."
- `agentwp_service_unavailable`: "Service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

## How to Verify

```bash
cd react && npm test -- --run tests/utils/error-code-alignment.test.ts
```

Expected: 20 tests pass (may show coverage threshold failures which are unrelated).

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Manual sync required**: The `BACKEND_ERROR_CODES` array in the test file must be manually updated when new error codes are added to `AgentWPConfig.php`. An alternative would be to generate this list from the PHP file during build, but that adds complexity.

2. **Acceptance criteria met**: Adding a new backend error code now requires:
   - Adding it to `BACKEND_ERROR_CODES` in the test file
   - Adding a corresponding message to `AGENTWP_ERROR_MESSAGES` in `error.ts`
   - Tests will fail if either step is missing
