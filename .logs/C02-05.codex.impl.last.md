Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Updated deprecation annotations and runtime warning text in `src/Intent/IntentClassifier.php` to reflect deprecation in 0.2.0 with planned removal in 1.0.0.
- Replaced deprecated `IntentClassifier` usage in test stubs with `IntentClassifierInterface` implementations in `tests/Integration/Intent/EngineTest.php`, `tests/Integration/Intent/ToolExecutionPathTest.php`, and `tests/Unit/Intent/EngineHooksTest.php` to avoid deprecation noise.
- Removed the unused `IntentClassifier` import from `tests/Integration/Container/ContainerWiringTest.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `vendor/bin/phpunit`

Risks / follow-ups:
- `docs/adr/0003-intent-classification-strategy.md` still references the 2.0.0/3.0.0 deprecation timeline; update if you want docs fully aligned.
