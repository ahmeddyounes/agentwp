**Self-Review Summary:**

The ADR `docs/adr/0002-intent-handler-registration.md` fully satisfies all acceptance criteria from the spec:

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Define single supported registration mechanism | ✅ `#[HandlesIntent(...)]` + `intent.handler` tag |
| Document backward compatibility for `agentwp_intent_handlers` | ✅ Lines 67-83 |
| Deprecation path for legacy `getIntent()`/`getSupportedIntents()` | ✅ Lines 85-116 |
| Include rationale | ✅ Comparison table (lines 50-57) + bullet points (lines 59-63) |
| Include consequences | ✅ Positive/Negative/Neutral (lines 118-134) |
| Include migration checklist | ✅ Core developers + third-party (lines 136-192) |
| Clearly state one true approach | ✅ Lines 24-46 |
| Clearly state how/when legacy removed | ✅ 3-phase deprecation path with version numbers |

**No changes needed.** The ADR is complete and follows the standard ADR format (Context → Decision → Consequences) with additional migration guidance.

**Summary:**
Created `docs/adr/0002-intent-handler-registration.md` that establishes `#[HandlesIntent]` attributes combined with `intent.handler` container tags as the single canonical registration mechanism. The ADR documents a clear deprecation timeline: soft deprecation now through v2.0, hard deprecation in v2.0 with `E_USER_DEPRECATED` notices, and complete removal of legacy support in v3.0.
