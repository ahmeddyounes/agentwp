Implemented resilient search backfill scheduling with safer locking, bounded runtime, and stuck recovery, plus updated docs/tests to reflect WP‑Cron behavior and state transitions.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added lock tokening, heartbeat tracking, stale schedule recovery, and per‑item deadline checks for bounded backfill runs in `src/Search/Index.php`.
- Expanded unit coverage for scheduling idempotence/stale recovery and lock release behavior in `tests/Unit/Search/BackfillTest.php`.
- Updated search index documentation for WP‑Cron scheduling, heartbeat/stuck troubleshooting, and revised timing guidance in `docs/search-index.md`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- N/A (no format/lint/test commands were provided)

Risks / follow-ups:
- Recovery still depends on WP‑Cron execution; sites with `DISABLE_WP_CRON` must run a real cron to avoid stalled backfills.
- If indexing a single item is slow, a run can exceed the window by a small amount; consider tuning backfill limits/window if needed.
