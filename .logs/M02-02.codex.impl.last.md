Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Added natural language order search execution with caching, date parsing, and simplified order output in `src/Handlers/OrderSearchHandler.php`.
- Wired intent order search to return real results via the new handler in `src/Intent/Handlers/OrderSearchHandler.php`.
- Clarified the tool schema email description in `src/AI/Functions/SearchOrders.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided.

Risks / follow-ups:
- Relative date ranges interpret “last week” as the previous 7 days ending yesterday; confirm this matches product expectations.
- Shipping email matching depends on `_shipping_email` meta, which may be absent on some stores.
