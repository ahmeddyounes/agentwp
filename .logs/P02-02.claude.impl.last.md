The implementation is complete. Let me provide the final summary:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

Added comprehensive extension pattern documentation for three key extensibility points in AgentWP:

### 1. `docs/EXTENSIONS.md` (+231 lines)
- **New section: "Registering a Custom REST Controller"** - Complete copy/pasteable example showing:
  - How to create a controller extending `RestController`
  - Route registration with GET/POST endpoints and parameter validation
  - Using container service resolution (`$this->resolve()`)
  - Response helpers (`response_success`, `response_error`)
  - Request validation against JSON schemas
  - Registration via `agentwp_register_providers` action with `rest.controller` tag
- Updated **Table of Contents** with all extension pattern subsections
- Updated **Summary Reference table** to include container tags (`intent.handler`, `rest.controller`)

### 2. `docs/DEVELOPER.md` (+110 lines)
- **New section: "Extension guide: custom REST controller"** - Concise version with:
  - Controller class example extending `RestController`
  - Service and controller registration pattern
  - Helper methods reference table
  - Link to EXTENSIONS.md for full example with update endpoints

### Examples already documented (verified as complete):
1. **Custom intent handler with `#[HandlesIntent]` + `intent.handler` tag** - Already in both files
2. **Custom scorers via `agentwp_intent_scorers` filter** - Already in both files

## How to verify

```bash
# Review the documentation changes
git diff docs/DEVELOPER.md docs/EXTENSIONS.md

# Verify markdown syntax (if you have a linter)
# The code blocks are balanced (opening/closing fences match)

# Review specific sections
grep -A 50 "Registering a Custom REST Controller" docs/EXTENSIONS.md
grep -A 40 "Extension guide: custom REST controller" docs/DEVELOPER.md
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **No automated testing for docs** - The examples are based on actual codebase patterns but aren't executed. Consider adding integration tests that validate the extension patterns work.

2. **Version coupling** - If `RestController` helper methods change, documentation may become stale. Consider using PHPDoc annotations that can generate this reference automatically.

3. **Missing service interface example** - The `ShipmentServiceInterface` and `ShipmentService` classes are referenced but not defined. This is intentional (keeping examples focused), but a full "from scratch" tutorial might be helpful for beginners.
