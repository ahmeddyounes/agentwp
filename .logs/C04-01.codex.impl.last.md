Status: DONE  
Bound the hooks/user interfaces to the WPFunctions singleton and removed IntentServiceProvider fallbacks so it resolves hooks purely from the container.

Summary of changes:
- Added bindings for `HooksInterface` and `WPUserFunctionsInterface` to the `WPFunctions` singleton in `src/Providers/CoreServiceProvider.php`.
- Switched IntentServiceProvider hook resolution to container-only and removed WPFunctions fallbacks in `src/Providers/IntentServiceProvider.php`.
- Updated unit setup to register `HooksInterface` in `tests/Unit/Intent/MemoryStoreConfigTest.php`.

How to verify (exact commands):
- No verification commands provided (format/lint/test entries were empty).

Risks / follow-ups:
- Tests not run (no commands provided).
- IntentServiceProvider now assumes a HooksInterface binding is present; ensure that binding is registered when using it outside CoreServiceProvider.
