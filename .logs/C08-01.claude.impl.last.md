**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**
- Created `docs/adr/0006-search-index-architecture.md` - an Architecture Decision Record that:
  - **Decides to keep `Index` as a static class** (no container registration)
  - Documents the rationale: WordPress activation timing, hook compatibility, limited consumer surface, integration test strategy, and cost-benefit analysis
  - Defines the **schema migration strategy** with version-based migrations using `dbDelta()` for additive changes and explicit migration methods for destructive changes
  - Documents **performance guardrails**: backfill limits (200 records/batch, 350ms window), query constraints (100 result cap, 3-char fulltext minimum), and required indexes
  - Outlines the **testing strategy** using integration tests against a WordPress test database
  - Provides a **future path** for thin interface extraction if testability needs change

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Read the ADR
cat docs/adr/0006-search-index-architecture.md

# Verify it follows the project's ADR format
ls -la docs/adr/
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- **Low risk**: This is a documentation-only change (ADR). No code changes were made.
- **Follow-up consideration**: If the team decides to pursue the container-managed approach in the future, the ADR documents the trade-offs and provides an adapter pattern for incremental migration.
